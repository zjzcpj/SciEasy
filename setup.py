"""Custom setuptools shim that bundles the frontend SPA into the wheel.

Most project metadata lives in ``pyproject.toml``. This file exists only to
hook a frontend-build step into ``python -m build`` / ``pip install .`` so
that end users get a working SPA out of ``scieasy gui`` without needing
Node locally at install time.

Flow
----
Whenever setuptools runs the ``build_py`` command (which happens during
wheel building, source installs, and editable installs), we:

1. Check whether ``src/scieasy/api/static/index.html`` already exists.
   If yes, we assume a previous invocation (or a pre-built sdist) already
   populated it and skip the build. This keeps offline / no-Node installs
   working as long as the static dir was pre-populated.
2. Otherwise, shell out to ``npm ci && npm run build`` inside
   ``frontend/`` and copy the resulting ``dist/`` tree into
   ``src/scieasy/api/static/``.
3. If Node is not available and the static dir is empty, we print a
   warning but do NOT fail the install — the runtime falls back to the
   Swagger panel so at least the API is reachable. See #389.

The runtime also has a dev fallback (``src/scieasy/api/app.py`` →
``_resolve_spa_static_dir``) that serves ``frontend/dist/`` directly when
the packaged static dir is empty, so editable installs work without ever
running this hook.
