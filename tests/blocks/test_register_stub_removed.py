"""Regression test for T-TRK-002: confirm the register stub is not exported.

The Phase 11 master plan §2.5 sub-1a + standards doc §9.1 T-TRK-002 deleted
``src/scieasy/blocks/process/builtins/register.py`` because it was a 1-line
docstring placeholder with no class body. Image registration belongs in
``scieasy-blocks-imaging`` (T-IMG-027/028/029 per the imaging spec); the core
``process/builtins/`` directory is reserved for plain DataObject collection
ops.

This test guards against accidental re-export of a register stub from the
``process/builtins`` package ``__init__`` during the Phase 11 plugin cascade.

NOTE on scope: this file is added under universal rule §6.10 (doc-external
changes restricted, but permitted when tests reveal missing things) to
satisfy the ``Verify Workflow Compliance`` CI gate which requires every
``src/`` change to be paired with a ``tests/`` change. The standards doc
T-TRK-002 §f originally said "New tests: none", but the CI gate makes a
single-line regression test strictly necessary. Called out in the PR body
per §6.10.
