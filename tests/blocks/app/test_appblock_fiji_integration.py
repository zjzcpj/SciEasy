"""T-TRK-015 — AppBlock + Fiji integration audit.

This module launches a real Fiji install through :class:`AppBlock` with a
headless macro fixture and audits four behaviours:

1. End-to-end launch-and-collect: Fiji opens the test image, applies a
   Gaussian blur, and writes the result to ``outputs/``; ``AppBlock``
   detects it and returns an ``Artifact``.
2. FileWatcher cleanup: after :meth:`AppBlock.run` returns, no new
   long-lived threads are left hanging from the watcher.
3. Process cleanup: the Fiji :class:`subprocess.Popen` spawned by the
   bridge is reaped (no zombie) after the block exits.
4. Exchange-directory cleanup: when the block is constructed with a
   tempfile-backed exchange dir (no ``project_dir``), the directory is
   removed on successful exit.

All four tests are guarded by ``@pytest.mark.requires_fiji`` and skipped
cleanly when Fiji is not installed at the master-plan §10 path.

Per the T-TRK-015 spec §j, this is an **audit**. If a behaviour test
exposes a bug in the current ``AppBlock``/``FileWatcher``/``bridge``
implementation, the test is marked ``xfail(strict=False)`` with a
pointer to the audit-finding issue — the fix lands in a separate PR.
