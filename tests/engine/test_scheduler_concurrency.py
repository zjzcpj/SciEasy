"""Concurrency tests for DAGScheduler (T-001, ADR-018 Addendum 1).

These tests cover the six scenarios required by the T-001 ticket:

1. Independent DAG branches run concurrently (wall clock ≈ max, not sum).
2. ResourceManager throttling retries dispatch when a slot frees.
3. Shutdown cleanup on exception terminates subprocesses and drains tasks.
4. Block cancel before subprocess starts takes the ``task.cancel()`` path.
5. Block cancel during subprocess run takes the ``ProcessHandle.terminate()``
   path.
6. Workflow cancel with a mix of running and ready/idle blocks transitions
   each block through the correct terminal state.

All tests use mock runners and a mock ProcessRegistry; no real subprocesses
are spawned.
