"""Smoke-test ``NoopBlock`` — relocated from the deleted production module.

Per Phase 11 master plan §2.5 sub-1a and ``docs/specs/phase11-implementation-standards.md``
T-TRK-003, this block was previously shipped as
``src/scieasy/blocks/process/builtins/transform.py::TransformBlock``. It is
not a placeholder — it is the smoke-test fixture used by the API/frontend
and execution-engine tests, just miscategorised. The body is preserved
verbatim (identity pass-through with optional sleep) so the existing
smoke tests continue to rely on identity-in == identity-out semantics.

Class name and ``type_name`` are updated:

* ``TransformBlock`` → ``NoopBlock``
* ``type_name = "process_block"`` → ``type_name = "noop"``

The block is no longer auto-registered as a core builtin. Tests that
need it under the legacy ``"process_block"`` registry alias rely on the
test-only registration hook in :mod:`tests.conftest`.
