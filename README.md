## What is SciEasy?

Modern biomedical research generates multi-modal datasets -- RNA/DNA sequencing, LC-MS metabolomics, spatial transcriptomics, immunofluorescence microscopy, SRS imaging, mass spectrometry imaging, and more. Each modality demands its own processing software, programming language, and data format. Researchers face two compounding problems:

1. **Fragmented processing**: tools are scattered across R scripts, Python notebooks, standalone GUI applications (ElMAVEN, Fiji, napari), and command-line pipelines. Exchanging intermediate results is manual, error-prone, and poorly documented.
2. **High barrier for non-developers**: researchers without strong programming backgrounds cannot efficiently chain together complex multi-step analyses, let alone integrate data across modalities.

SciEasy is a **modality-agnostic, building-block workflow framework** where:

- Every processing step is encapsulated as a **Block** with standardized inputs and outputs.
- All data flows through a small set of **base data types** that are extensible via inheritance.
- Users compose workflows visually by wiring blocks together on a canvas -- no code required for standard pipelines.
- Existing tools are **included, not replaced**: users can embed R/Python scripts, launch GUI applications, or call CLI tools as blocks within the same workflow.
- Multiple data modalities coexist in a **single workflow graph**, enabling true cross-modal fusion analysis.
- The framework is **AI-native**: AI can generate blocks, synthesize workflows, and optimize parameters at runtime.

> **Status**: SciEasy is in **pre-alpha** (v0.1.0-dev). The core runtime, block system, execution engine, API layer, and frontend workflow editor are implemented and under active development. See [Current Status](#current-status) for details.

## Key Features

### Type-Safe Data Model

Six base data types -- `Array`, `Series`, `DataFrame`, `Text`, `Artifact`, and `CompositeData` -- cover the full spectrum of scientific data. Domain-specific types (e.g., `Image`, `Spectrum`, `PeakTable`, `AnnData`, `SpatialData`) extend these bases. Port-level type checking prevents invalid connections at design time.

### Lazy by Default

Data objects hold references, not payloads. A 100 GB dataset stays on disk (Zarr, Parquet, or filesystem) until a block requests a specific slice via `ViewProxy`. Memory usage stays bounded even for enormous datasets.

### Five Block Categories + Composition

| Category | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **IOBlock** | Load and save data in any format (mzXML, TIFF, CSV, h5ad, Zarr, etc.) |
| **ProcessBlock** | Deterministic data transformations (denoise, segment, merge, filter) |
| **CodeBlock** | Run user-provided Python, R, or Julia scripts |
| **AppBlock** | Bridge external GUI software (ElMAVEN, Fiji, napari, MestReNova) via file exchange |
| **AIBlock** | LLM-powered classification, summarization, and parameter suggestion |
| **SubWorkflowBlock** | Encapsulate an entire workflow as a single reusable block |

### Manual Steps Are First-Class

Human review, annotation, and approval are part of the formal workflow model -- not hacks. AppBlock pauses the workflow while the user operates external software, then automatically resumes when output files appear.

### Subprocess Isolation

All blocks execute in isolated subprocesses. The engine process is a pure orchestrator that never executes block logic directly. This provides reliable cancellation (OS-level process signals), crash isolation (a segfault in one block does not affect others), and hang protection.

### Event-Driven Execution Engine

The DAG scheduler reacts to block completion, errors, cancellation, and process death events via an `EventBus`. Features include parallel execution of independent branches, cancellation with automatic skip propagation to downstream blocks, pause/resume with checkpoint persistence, and resource-aware dispatch gating (GPU slots, CPU cores, OS memory monitoring via psutil).

### Community-Extensible Plugin System

- **Tier 1 (drop-in)**: place a `.py` file in `{project}/blocks/` or `~/.scieasy/blocks/` -- it appears in the palette immediately.
- **Tier 2 (pip install)**: publish a block package to PyPI with `scieasy.blocks` entry-points. Users install with `pip install scieasy-yourpackage` and blocks register automatically.
- **Block SDK**: `scieasy init-block-package` scaffolds a complete package; `BlockTestHarness` simplifies testing.

### Visual Workflow Editor

A React + ReactFlow frontend provides a drag-and-drop canvas for composing workflows, with real-time execution state updates via WebSocket, inline block configuration, type-colored port handles, and data preview panels.

## Architecture Overview

SciEasy is organized into six horizontal layers, each depending only on the layers below it:

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|  Layer 6: Frontend                                          |
|  ReactFlow canvas, block palette, monitoring dashboard      |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|  Layer 5: API + SPA Serving                                 |
|  FastAPI REST, WebSocket, SSE, SPA fallback middleware      |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|  Layer 4: AI Services                                       |
|  Block generation, workflow synthesis, param optimization   |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|  Layer 3: Execution Engine                                  |
|  DAG scheduler, process lifecycle, resource management      |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|  Layer 2: Block System                                      |
|  Port typing, block registry, state machine, runners        |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|  Layer 1: Data Foundation                                   |
|  Type hierarchy, storage backends, lazy loading, lineage    |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|  Plugin Ecosystem (cross-cutting)                           |
|  Entry-points protocol, Block SDK, community blocks         |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
```

**Workflow graph is the source of truth.** The graph definition, runtime state, block contracts, lineage, and execution semantics belong to the backend/runtime layer. The frontend is an editor and viewer, not the source of truth.

**Data flows as references, not large in-memory payloads.** Objects passed between blocks are typed object references backed by storage (Zarr for arrays, Parquet for tables, filesystem for files). The `Collection` transport wrapper carries batches of items between blocks without the engine ever unpacking or inspecting the contents.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or later
- Node.js 18+ (only for frontend development; not needed for `pip install`)

### Installation

**End users** — one command from PyPI:

```bash
pip install scieasy
scieasy gui
```

The wheel ships with the prebuilt React SPA, so `scieasy gui` opens the full
workflow editor directly. No Node.js required at install time.

**Developers** — clone and install editable:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zjzcpj/SciEasy.git
cd SciEasy
pip install -e ".[dev]"
(cd frontend && npm install && npm run build)   # one-time SPA build
scieasy gui
```

The dev path serves the SPA from `frontend/dist/` automatically, so you can
iterate on Python + SPA without reinstalling. For hot-reload frontend dev,
run `(cd frontend && npm run dev)` against a separate `scieasy serve`
backend — Vite proxies `/api/*` to `http://localhost:8000`.

> If `scieasy gui` lands on the FastAPI `/docs` page instead of the workflow
> editor, the SPA bundle is missing. Run `(cd frontend && npm run build)` in
> your dev checkout, or reinstall from a wheel that includes `scieasy/api/static/index.html`.

### Launch the GUI

```bash
scieasy gui
```

This starts the FastAPI backend and opens the workflow editor in your default browser at `http://localhost:8000`.

### CLI Commands

```bash
scieasy --help          # Show all available commands
scieasy init            # Initialize a new project workspace
scieasy validate FILE   # Validate a workflow YAML file
scieasy run FILE        # Execute a workflow from a YAML file
scieasy blocks          # List all registered blocks
scieasy serve           # Start API server (headless, no browser)
scieasy gui             # Start API server and open browser
```

## Project Workspace

When you create a project in SciEasy, it generates a self-contained directory:

```
my_project/
├── project.yaml              # Project metadata and settings
├── workflows/                # Workflow DAG definitions (YAML)
├── data/
│   ├── raw/                  # Original uploaded files (read-only after import)
│   ├── zarr/                 # Zarr stores for Array-type data
│   ├── parquet/              # Parquet files for DataFrame-type data
│   └── artifacts/            # PDFs, reports, images, other files
├── blocks/                   # Project-local custom blocks (drop-in .py files)
├── types/                    # Project-local custom data types (drop-in .py files)
├── checkpoints/              # Serialized workflow states for pause/resume
├── lineage/                  # SQLite lineage database
└── logs/                     # Execution logs
```

---

## Writing Custom Blocks

### Drop-in Block (Tier 1)

Save a `.py` file in your project's `blocks/` directory:

```python
from scieasy.blocks.base import ProcessBlock, InputPort, OutputPort
from scieasy.core.types import Spectrum

class RamanDenoise(ProcessBlock):
    name = "Raman denoise"
    description = "Savitzky-Golay smoothing for Raman spectra"
    version = "0.1.0"
    category = "spectroscopy"

    input_ports = [InputPort(name="spectrum", accepted_types=[Spectrum])]
    output_ports = [OutputPort(name="smoothed", accepted_types=[Spectrum])]

    def process_item(self, item, config):
        from scipy.signal import savgol_filter
        data = item.view().to_memory()
        return savgol_filter(data, config.get("window", 11), config.get("order", 3))
```

Click "Reload Blocks" in the GUI and it appears in the palette.

### Publishable Package (Tier 2)

For community distribution:

```bash
scieasy init-block-package scieasy-blocks-mylab
```

This scaffolds a complete package with entry-points, example blocks, tests using `BlockTestHarness`, and a README. Publish to PyPI and users install with `pip install scieasy-blocks-mylab`.

- Import contract verification (layer dependency rules)

---

## Contributing

SciEasy follows a structured development workflow to ensure traceability and architectural consistency. Please read [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) for the full set of development rules, including:

- **Branch discipline**: all changes go through PRs; no direct push to main.
- **Gate workflow**: every task follows a 6-stage pipeline (issue, change plan, branch, PR, docs, changelog).
- **Focused commits**: use conventional commit messages (`feat(module):`, `fix(module):`, `docs:`, etc.).
- **Tests are part of the change**: bug fixes include regression tests; new features include validation tests.
- **Architecture boundaries**: enforced by import-linter contracts in CI.

### Architecture Decision Records

Significant design decisions are documented as ADRs in [`docs/adr/ADR.md`](docs/adr/ADR.md). Notable decisions include:

| ADR | Decision |
|-----|----------|
| ADR-017 | Subprocess isolation for all blocks |
| ADR-018 | Event-driven scheduler with CANCELLED/SKIPPED states |
| ADR-019 | Cross-platform ProcessHandle abstraction |
| ADR-020 | Collection-based data transport between blocks |
| ADR-021 | Collection operation blocks (merge, split, filter, slice) |
| ADR-022 | psutil-based OS memory monitoring (replacing per-block estimates) |
| ADR-023 | Frontend layout redesign (three-column with bottom panel) |
| ADR-024 | Frontend bundling into Python wheel + `scieasy gui` command |
| ADR-025 | Plugin entry-points callable protocol with PackageInfo |
| ADR-026 | Block SDK (scaffolding, test harness, developer docs) |
