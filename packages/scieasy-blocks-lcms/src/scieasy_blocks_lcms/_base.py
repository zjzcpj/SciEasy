"""Shared mixin for all LC-MS plugin blocks (Phase 11 skeleton).

Per ``docs/specs/phase11-lcms-block-spec.md`` §9, every LC-MS block
mixes in :class:`_LCMSBlockMixin` ahead of its concrete base class
(``IOBlock`` / ``ProcessBlock`` / ``AppBlock`` / ``CodeBlock``). The
mixin is the single place that pins plugin-wide ClassVars (currently
just ``category``) so the GUI palette groups every LC-MS block under
the same node-tree branch and the registry can identify which plugin
contributed a given block at scan time.

Body is intentionally tiny — this file is part of the T-LCMS-002
skeleton drop and is finalised by the implementation cascade
(skeleton @ c08a885).
