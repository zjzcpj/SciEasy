"""FileWatcher — polling-based output detection for AppBlock.

Uses a simple polling loop to detect new or modified files matching glob
patterns.  A watchdog-based implementation can be added later for lower
latency, but polling is reliable across all platforms and avoids adding
watchdog as a hard runtime dependency for the watcher alone.
