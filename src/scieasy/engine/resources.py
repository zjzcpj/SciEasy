"""ResourceManager — GPU slots, CPU workers, OS memory monitoring.

ADR-022: OS-level memory monitoring via psutil replaces estimated_memory_gb.
Reactive dispatch gating instead of predictive static estimates.

ADR-018: Auto-release on terminal block states via EventBus subscription.

ADR-027 D10: ``ResourceManager`` auto-detects physical GPU count when
``gpu_slots`` is ``None`` (the new default). The probe tries
``torch.cuda.device_count()`` first, then ``nvidia-smi -L``, then returns 0.
Explicit integer values are respected unchanged. When auto-detect returns 0
but a block declares ``requires_gpu=True``, a single WARNING is emitted from
``can_dispatch`` pointing the user at the project-config override.
