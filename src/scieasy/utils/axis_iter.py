"""scieasy.utils.axis_iter — single-Array extra-axis iteration utility.

Implements ADR-027 D3 (``iterate_over_axes``). The function iterates a
caller-supplied ``func`` over all axes in a source :class:`Array` that
are *not* in ``operates_on``, applying ``func`` to each slice and
stacking the results back into a new instance of the source's concrete
class.

This is the common case for 5D / 6D imaging blocks: "I know how to
process ``(y, x)``, please loop over everything else (``t``, ``z``,
``c``, ...)". The sister utility
:func:`scieasy.utils.broadcast.broadcast_apply` covers the complementary
cross-modal case (a low-dim source projected onto a high-dim target
along named axes).

Memory: O(one input slice + one output slice). Serial by design — no
threads, no asyncio, no multiprocessing (ADR-027 D3 §"Memory" / D8).
Errors raised inside the user-provided ``func`` propagate unchanged and
are NOT wrapped in :class:`BroadcastError`.

Metadata propagation follows ADR-027 D5:

- ``framework``: regenerated via ``source.framework.derive()`` (which
  sets ``derived_from=source.framework.object_id`` by default and gives
  the result a fresh ``object_id`` / ``created_at``).
- ``meta``: shared by reference (Pydantic models are frozen).
- ``user``: shallow copy.
- ``axes``: same as ``source.axes`` — results are stacked back onto the
  original shape so no axis is added or removed. ``func`` must therefore
  return an array whose number of dimensions equals ``len(operates_on)``;
  this is validated explicitly and a mismatch raises
  :class:`BroadcastError`.

Note on ``BroadcastError``: ADR-027 D3's pseudocode imports from
``scieasy.core.exceptions``, but that module does not (yet) exist. The
sibling :mod:`scieasy.utils.broadcast` already defines
:class:`BroadcastError`, so this module imports it from there. Keeping
the two utilities' error type identical is explicitly desirable: a
caller wiring these together wants the same ``except BroadcastError:``
clause to catch both.

    For each combination of the non-``operates_on`` axis indices, calls::

        func(slice_data, slice_coord)

    where ``slice_data`` is a numpy array containing only the
    ``operates_on`` dimensions (in the order they appear in
    ``source.axes``) and ``slice_coord`` is a dict mapping each
    extra-axis name to its current integer index.

    Results are stacked back into a new instance of ``type(source)``,
    preserving ``axes`` and ``shape`` and propagating metadata per
    ADR-027 D5: ``framework`` is derived (lineage hint back to parent),
    ``meta`` is shared by reference (Pydantic models are frozen), and
    ``user`` is shallow-copied.

    Example::

        # source: FluorImage(axes=["t", "z", "c", "y", "x"],
        #                    shape=(10, 30, 4, 512, 512))
        # operates_on = {"y", "x"}
        # -> 10 * 30 * 4 = 1200 calls to func, each with a (512, 512) slice

        )
        # result has the same axes and shape as source.

    Args:
        source: An :class:`Array` (or subclass) with ``.axes``,
            ``.shape``, and ``.to_memory()``. Must have a known shape.
        operates_on: Set of axis names that ``func`` knows how to
            handle. Must be a subset of ``source.axes``.
        func: Callable that receives a numpy slice and a coord dict and
            returns a transformed numpy array. All returned arrays must
            have the same shape so they can be stacked back into a
            single array, and must have exactly ``len(operates_on)``
            dimensions.

    Returns:
        A new instance of ``type(source)`` with the same ``axes`` as
        ``source``, shape ``source_extra_shape + func_output_shape``
        (which equals ``source.shape`` when ``func`` preserves each
        slice's shape), dtype inferred from the first slice's result,
        and metadata propagated per ADR-027 D5.

    Raises:
        BroadcastError: if ``operates_on`` is not a subset of
            ``source.axes``; if ``source.shape`` is ``None``; if any
            pair of slice outputs have different shapes; or if ``func``
            returns an array whose number of dimensions differs from
            ``len(operates_on)``.

    Note:
        This function is serial by design. Block-internal parallelism
        is the block author's choice per ADR-027 D8 / D13 and is
        explicitly forbidden inside this utility.
