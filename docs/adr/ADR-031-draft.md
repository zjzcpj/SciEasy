## ADR-031: Data Object Reference-Only Contract, ViewProxy Elimination, and Lazy Loading Enforcement

**Status**: draft
**Date**: 2026-04-11
**Supersedes**: ADR-027 Addendum 1 (~~proposed~~ → **deprecated**)
**Amends**: ADR-007 (implementation alignment), ADR-017 (transport contract), ADR-028 (IOBlock contract)

---

### 1. Purpose

This ADR addresses a **critical divergence between architectural design and implementation** across the data storage, transport, and access layers. An independent audit (ref: `docs/data-storage-transport-audit.en.md`, 2026-04-11) confirmed that the "lazy by default" principle from ADR-007 is systematically violated in practice.

This ADR:

1. Establishes **DataObject as the single, definitive data reference type** — no secondary accessor classes.
2. **Eliminates `ViewProxy`** entirely — its methods are absorbed into DataObject/Array.
3. **Prohibits the `_data` / `_arrow_table` in-memory backdoor** on DataObject instances that cross block boundaries.
4. **Requires IOBlock loaders to persist data to storage and return reference-only objects.**
5. **Exempts Artifact/file-handle types from auto-flush** — path-only transport.
6. **Deprecates ADR-027 Addendum 1** in its entirety; correct decisions are restated here.
7. **Aligns documentation** to a single coherent model.

### 2. Context

#### 2.1 Design intent (ADR-007, ADR-017, ADR-027)

The architecture specifies:

> DataObject instances are lightweight wrappers (~KB) holding a StorageReference. Blocks never receive raw data directly. — ADR-007

> No scientific data crosses the process boundary. Only StorageReference pointers (~100 bytes each) and config dicts cross. — ADR-017

> `worker.reconstruct_inputs` returns typed DataObject instances, not ViewProxy. Lazy loading is preserved at the method level. — ADR-027 Addendum 1

#### 2.2 Actual implementation state (audit findings)

The independent audit (`docs/data-storage-transport-audit.en.md`) found:

1. **Almost all loaders are eager.** Only `LoadData(.zarr)` returns a storage-backed reference. All other paths (`LoadImage` TIFF/Zarr, `LoadData` .npy/.csv/.parquet/.json, plugin loaders) read full data into memory and attach it to an undeclared `_data` or `_arrow_table` attribute. Evidence: `load_data.py:233-427`, `load_image.py:76-141`.

2. **`_data` is not part of the DataObject contract.** The `DataObject.__init__` constructor has four declared slots: `framework`, `meta`, `user`, `storage_ref`. The `_data` attribute appears nowhere in the base class. It is monkey-patched onto instances by loader code: `img._data = np.asarray(...)`. The base class's `get_in_memory_data()` legitimizes this via `hasattr(self, "_data")` — a contract violation that the framework itself endorses.

3. **ViewProxy is vestigial.** ADR-027 Addendum 1 demoted ViewProxy from "engine-injected input type" to "opt-in helper via `item.view()`". In practice, **zero package-level blocks call `item.view()`**. ViewProxy's sole runtime role is as an unnecessary intermediary in `DataObject.to_memory()` → `self.view().to_memory()`. The class adds indirection without value.

4. **The transport layer is reference-based, but load/process/export are not.** The scheduler→worker JSON wire protocol correctly transmits StorageReference pointers. But data enters the system as in-memory blobs (load), gets processed as in-memory blobs (process), and gets exported from in-memory blobs (save). The reference-based transport is sandwiched between eager endpoints.

5. **SaveData cannot reliably export storage-backed objects.** `_save_array()` calls `obj.get_in_memory_data()`, which succeeds only if `_data` is set. A storage-backed Array (reconstructed in worker with only `storage_ref`) has no `_data`, causing `get_in_memory_data()` to raise. Evidence: `save_data.py:280-348`, `base.py:350-362`.

6. **`LoadData(Series)` loses payload.** `_load_series()` returns a `Series()` with neither `_data`, `_arrow_table`, nor `storage_ref`. The data is silently discarded. Evidence: `load_data.py:456-468`.

7. **`LoadPeakTable` stores pandas DataFrame in `user` metadata.** The `user` dict requires JSON-serializability per ADR-017. A pandas DataFrame is not JSON-serializable. This silently breaks cross-process transport. Evidence: `load_peak_table.py:123-134`.

8. **Artifact file semantics are broken by auto-flush.** `MSRawFile` is designed as a path handle, but `_auto_flush()` calls `get_in_memory_data()` which reads the file's raw bytes, then writes them to managed storage. The original file semantics are lost. Evidence: `block.py:374-403`, `artifact.py:44-48`.

9. **`Array.sel()` materializes full data before slicing.** The method that should enable lazy partial reads (`sel(z=5)`) starts by calling `self.to_memory()` to load the entire array. Evidence: `array.py:165-223`.

10. **Documentation mixes two generations.** `ARCHITECTURE.md:331-362` describes the old ViewProxy-injection model. `ADR.md:4659-5135` (ADR-027 Addendum 1) describes typed DataObject reconstruction. The code matches the newer model, but the architectural docs still reference the old one.

#### 2.3 Why ADR-027 Addendum 1 is deprecated

ADR-027 Addendum 1 made several correct observations but stopped short of the necessary conclusion:

- **Correct**: worker should return typed DataObject, not ViewProxy.
- **Correct**: `_reconstruct_extra_kwargs` / `_serialise_extra_metadata` hooks are the right per-class reconstruction pattern.
- **Correct**: Meta Pydantic constraints (frozen, JSON-round-trippable) are necessary.
- **Incorrect**: ViewProxy should be "demoted to opt-in helper." It should be **deleted** — no block uses it, and its functionality belongs on DataObject directly.
- **Incomplete**: Did not address the `_data` backdoor, loader eagerness, SaveData breakage, or Artifact semantics.
- **Incomplete**: Did not establish DataObject as the single source of truth for data access methods.

This ADR supersedes ADR-027 Addendum 1 in full. Decisions that remain correct are restated below with updated rationale.

---

### 3. Decisions

#### D1. DataObject is the single data reference type (source of truth)

**D1.1 Type hierarchy and per-class responsibilities**

```
DataObject (base)
├── Array          — N-dimensional numeric data (images, spectra, tensors)
│   ├── Image      — 2D/3D images (plugin)
│   ├── Label      — segmentation masks (plugin, CompositeData subclass)
│   └── ...
├── DataFrame      — tabular data (columns + rows)
├── Series         — single-column data
├── Text           — string content
├── Artifact       — opaque file handle (PDF, binary, raw instrument files)
│   └── MSRawFile  — mass spec raw data (plugin)
└── CompositeData  — named slots of DataObjects
    └── Label      — raster + metadata slots (plugin)
```

**D1.2 DataObject base class contract**

DataObject holds exactly four declared slots:
- `_framework: FrameworkMeta` — identity and lineage
- `_meta: BaseModel | None` — typed metadata
- `_user: dict[str, Any]` — free-form metadata (JSON-serializable)
- `_storage_ref: StorageReference | None` — pointer to persisted data

**DataObject MUST NOT carry raw data payloads.** There is no `_data` attribute, no `_arrow_table` attribute, no in-memory data container of any kind on DataObject instances that cross block boundaries.

**DataObject provides these data access methods** (all route through `storage_ref` → backend):

| Method | Defined on | Behavior |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| `to_memory()` | **DataObject** | Materialize full data from storage. Emits 2GB size warning. |
| `get_in_memory_data()` | **DataObject** | Alias for `to_memory()`. Subclasses may override (Text, Artifact). |
| `slice(*args)` | **DataObject** | Backend-specific sub-selection (zarr indexing, arrow column filter, etc.) |
| `iter_chunks(chunk_size)` | **DataObject** | Yield successive chunks from storage. |

**D1.3 Array subclass contract**

Array adds geometry metadata and array-specific access methods. These are **declared constructor parameters**, not monkey-patched attributes:

| Attribute/Method | Defined on | Type | Notes |
|-----------------|-----------|------|-------|
| `axes` | **Array** (constructor) | `list[str]` | Named axes, e.g. `["z", "y", "x", "c"]` |
| `shape` | **Array** (constructor) | `tuple[int, ...] \| None` | Data dimensions |
| `dtype` | **Array** (constructor) | `str \| None` | Element type |
| `chunk_shape` | **Array** (constructor) | `tuple[int, ...] \| None` | Storage chunk hint |
| `sel(**kwargs)` | **Array** | `-> Array` | Partial read along named axes. Reads from storage, not `_data`. |
| `iter_over(axis)` | **Array** | `-> Iterator[Array]` | Yield slices along one axis. Each slice has `storage_ref` set. |
| `__array__(dtype)` | **Array** | `-> np.ndarray` | NumPy protocol. Calls `to_memory()`. |

**Key change**: `sel()` and `iter_over()` no longer stash results in `_data`. Slice results are persisted to a temporary zarr store and returned with `storage_ref` set. This maintains the reference-only contract even for derived slices.

**D1.4 DataFrame subclass contract**

| Attribute/Method | Defined on | Notes |
|-----------------|-----------|-------|
| `to_memory()` | Inherited from **DataObject** | Returns `pyarrow.Table` from arrow backend |
| `get_in_memory_data()` | Inherited from **DataObject** | Same as `to_memory()` |

**Key change**: No `_arrow_table` attribute. All data access goes through `storage_ref` → ArrowBackend. The `_arrow_table` pattern is eliminated.

**D1.5 Text subclass contract**

| Attribute/Method | Defined on | Notes |
|-----------------|-----------|-------|
| `content` | **Text** (constructor) | String content. Small enough to hold in memory. |
| `get_in_memory_data()` | **Text** (override) | Returns `self.content` directly. |

Text is exempt from the "no in-memory data" rule because text content is inherently small (~KB) and is part of the object's identity (e.g., a prompt string). `storage_ref` is optional for Text.

**D1.6 Artifact subclass contract**

| Attribute/Method | Defined on | Notes |
|-----------------|-----------|-------|
| `file_path` | **Artifact** (constructor) | Path to the opaque file on disk. |
| `mime_type` | **Artifact** (constructor) | MIME type string. |
| `get_in_memory_data()` | **Artifact** (override) | Reads bytes from `file_path`. |

Artifact uses **path-only transport** — `file_path` is the reference, not `storage_ref`. Artifact is exempt from auto-flush (D5). `_auto_flush()` skips Artifact instances with `file_path` set.

**D1.7 CompositeData subclass contract**

CompositeData holds named slots, each of which is a DataObject. Each slot independently follows the storage-ref contract. The CompositeStore backend handles recursive persistence.

#### D2. ViewProxy is deleted

The `ViewProxy` class (`src/scieasy/core/proxy.py`) is deleted entirely. Its functionality is absorbed into the type hierarchy as follows:

| ViewProxy method | New location | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `to_memory()` | **DataObject**.`to_memory()` | Direct backend read via `_get_backend(self._storage_ref).read(...)`. Includes 2GB size warning. |
| `slice(*args)` | **DataObject**.`slice(*args)` | Direct backend call. |
| `iter_chunks(chunk_size)` | **DataObject**.`iter_chunks(chunk_size)` | Direct backend call. |
| `shape` property | **Array**.`shape` | Already a constructor parameter on Array. Not on DataObject. |
| `axes` property | **Array**.`axes` | Already a constructor parameter on Array. Not on DataObject. |
| `from_file(path)` | Removed | Use `Artifact(file_path=Path(path))` or construct DataObject with appropriate `storage_ref`. |
| `_get_backend(ref)` | Module-level utility in `scieasy.core.storage.backend_router` | Shared backend resolution, used by DataObject methods internally. |

**`DataObject.view()` is deleted.** There is no ViewProxy path. Block authors call methods directly on the typed instance:

```python
# OLD (via ViewProxy):
data = image.view().to_memory()        # indirection through ViewProxy
chunk = image.view().slice(0, 100)     # indirection through ViewProxy

# NEW (direct on DataObject/Array):
data = image.to_memory()               # DataObject method, direct backend call
sub = image.sel(z=5)                   # Array method, direct backend call
for chunk in image.iter_chunks(1024):  # DataObject method, direct backend call
    ...
```

#### D3. `_data` and `_arrow_table` are prohibited on cross-boundary DataObjects

**Rule**: Any DataObject returned from `Block.run()` (or `IOBlock.load()`) MUST have `storage_ref` set (or `file_path` for Artifact). The framework enforces this at the IOBlock level (D4) and at the worker auto-flush boundary.

**Transient in-memory data within a single block's `run()` is allowed.** A block may compute results in memory (e.g., CellPose producing a mask ndarray). The framework's existing `_auto_flush()` mechanism persists these to storage before the data crosses the process boundary. This behavior is unchanged.

**Per-class elimination of in-memory backdoors:**

| Class | Attribute removed | Current usage | Migration |
|-------|------------------|---------------|-----------|
| **Array** | `_data` (monkey-patched, not declared) | Set by loaders: `img._data = np.asarray(...)`. Checked by `Array.to_memory()`, `Array.sel()`, `get_in_memory_data()`. | Remove all `_data` assignments and `hasattr` checks. All data access routes through `storage_ref` → ZarrBackend. |
| **DataFrame** | `_arrow_table` (monkey-patched, not declared) | Set by loaders: `df._arrow_table = table`. Checked by `get_in_memory_data()`, `_dataframe_to_arrow_table()`. | Remove all `_arrow_table` assignments and checks. All data access routes through `storage_ref` → ArrowBackend. |
| **Series** | `_arrow_table` (inherited pattern from DataFrame) | Set inconsistently. `_load_series()` currently loses payload entirely. | Fix payload loss first (write to arrow backend). Then same migration as DataFrame. |
| **Text** | `content` (declared constructor parameter) | **Exempt.** Text content is small (~KB) and is part of the object's identity. `content` is a legitimate declared field, not a monkey-patched backdoor. | No change. |
| **Artifact** | `file_path` (declared constructor parameter) | **Exempt.** File path is the transport mechanism. | No change. See D5. |
| **CompositeData** | Per-slot `_data`/`_arrow_table` on slot objects | Each slot is independently a DataObject. | Recursive: each slot follows its own class's migration. |

**What `_auto_flush()` handles after this ADR**: Only transient outputs from ProcessBlock/CodeBlock/AppBlock `run()` methods — block authors who compute results in memory and don't explicitly persist them. The framework flushes these to storage before serialization. IOBlock loaders are expected to handle their own persistence (D4).

#### D4. IOBlock base class guarantees storage-ref; provides persistence helpers for loader authors

The `load()` signature changes to accept an `output_dir` parameter. The IOBlock base class provides two guarantees:

1. **Correctness guarantee**: After `load()` returns, the base class checks every DataObject. If `storage_ref` is missing, the base class auto-flushes to storage. **No DataObject without `storage_ref` ever crosses the block boundary.** This is a safety net — loader authors who return in-memory objects still produce correct results.

2. **Helper API**: The base class provides `persist_array()` and `persist_table()` helpers for loader authors who want streaming writes (constant memory). **Loader authors who know their data is large SHOULD use these helpers.** Loader authors who don't care can return in-memory objects and let the base class handle persistence.

**The framework guarantees correctness. The loader author controls optimality.** Loader authors know their data characteristics — a 1KB CSV doesn't need streaming; a 100G TIFF does.

**New `IOBlock` contract:**

```python
class IOBlock(Block):
    @abstractmethod
    def load(self, config: BlockConfig, output_dir: str) -> DataObject | Collection:
        """Load data from source.

        Implementations may EITHER:

        (a) Return an in-memory DataObject (simple path):
            The base class auto-persists it to storage. Works for small/medium
            files. Will OOM on very large files.

            return Image(_data=np.array(...), axes=["y","x"], shape=shape, dtype=dtype)

        (b) Write to storage directly and return a reference (streaming path):
            Use self.persist_array() / self.persist_table() helpers for
            constant-memory writes. Required for large files.

            ref = self.persist_array(chunks_iter, shape, dtype, output_dir)
            return Image(storage_ref=ref, axes=["y","x"], shape=shape, dtype=dtype)

        Artifact subclasses are exempt — return with file_path, no storage write needed.
        """
        ...

        self, data_or_iterator, shape, dtype, output_dir, chunks=None,
    ) -> StorageReference:

        ...

    def persist_table(self, table, output_dir) -> StorageReference:
        """Write Arrow table to storage, return StorageReference."""
        ...

    # -- run() with auto-flush safety net ---

    def run(self, inputs, config):
        if self.direction == "input":
            output_dir = get_output_dir()
            result = self.load(config, output_dir=output_dir)
            if not isinstance(result, Collection):
                result = Collection(items=[result], item_type=type(result))
            # Safety net: auto-flush any item without storage_ref
            for item in result:
                if isinstance(item, DataObject) and item.storage_ref is None:
                    if not (isinstance(item, Artifact) and item.file_path is not None):
                        self._auto_flush(item)  # persist to zarr/arrow, set storage_ref
            return {self._resolved_load_output_port_name(): result}
```

**Example: LoadImage TIFF — streaming path (large files, constant memory):**

```python
def load(self, config, output_dir=None):
    path = Path(config.get("path"))

    with tifffile.TiffFile(str(path)) as tf:
        page0 = tf.pages[0]
        shape = (len(tf.pages), *page0.shape) if len(tf.pages) > 1 else page0.shape
        dtype = page0.dtype
        axes = _infer_axes(tf)

        # Stream page-by-page — memory = O(one page)
        def page_chunks():
            for i, page in enumerate(tf.pages):
                yield (i, page.asarray())

        ref = self.persist_array(page_chunks(), shape, dtype, output_dir)

    return Image(axes=axes, shape=shape, dtype=dtype, storage_ref=ref)
    # ← ~KB object. No _data, no in-memory payload.
```

**Example: LoadData CSV — simple path (small files, base class handles persistence):**

```python
def _load_dataframe(self, path, config, output_dir):
    import pyarrow.csv as pcsv
    table = pcsv.read_csv(str(path))
    # Return in-memory — base class will auto-persist via _auto_flush
    df = DataFrame()
    df._arrow_table = table  # OK for simple path; base class flushes this
    return df
```

**Example: LoadData CSV — streaming path (large files):**

```python
def _load_dataframe(self, path, config, output_dir):
    import pyarrow.csv as pcsv
    table = pcsv.read_csv(str(path))
    ref = self.persist_table(table, output_dir)
    return DataFrame(storage_ref=ref)
    # ← Reference only. No _arrow_table.
```

**Loader author's choice matrix:**

| Data size | Approach | Memory | Code complexity |
|-----------|----------|--------|-----------------|
| Small (< 1GB) | Return in-memory, base class auto-flushes | O(file size) | Minimal — same as today |
| Large (> 1GB) | Use `persist_array()` / `persist_table()` streaming helpers | O(chunk size) | Slightly more — iterate chunks |

**All 6 loader classes should be updated to use the new `load(config, output_dir)` signature.** Whether each individual loader function uses the simple path or streaming path is the loader author's decision based on expected data size:

| Loader | Recommended path | Rationale |
|--------|-----------------|-----------|
| `LoadImage` TIFF | Streaming | Scientific images routinely exceed 1GB |
| `LoadImage` Zarr | Reference | Zarr is already chunked storage — reference existing store |
| `LoadData` Array .zarr | Reference | Already lazy (only correct loader today) |
| `LoadData` Array .npy/.npz | Simple | Typically small; streaming .npy is not straightforward |
| `LoadData` DataFrame csv/parquet | Simple or Streaming | Author's choice based on expected table size |
| `LoadData` Text | Simple | Text files are small |
| `LoadData` Artifact | Exempt | Path-only transport (D5) |
| LCMS loaders | Simple | Domain-specific, typically small tables |

#### D5. Artifact and file-handle types skip auto-flush

`Artifact` and its subclasses (e.g., `MSRawFile`) use `file_path` as their transport mechanism, not `storage_ref`. They represent opaque files that should not be read into memory or copied into managed storage.

**`_auto_flush()` is modified to skip Artifact instances that have `file_path` set:**

```python
@staticmethod
def _auto_flush(obj: Any) -> Any:
    if not isinstance(obj, DataObject):
        return obj
    # NEW: Artifact with file_path uses path-only transport
    from scieasy.core.types.artifact import Artifact
    if isinstance(obj, Artifact) and obj.file_path is not None:
        return obj
    # ... existing flush logic ...
```

**Serialization**: `_serialise_one()` already handles Artifact via `_serialise_extra_metadata()` which writes `file_path` to the metadata sidecar. `_reconstruct_one()` already handles it via `_reconstruct_extra_kwargs()` which restores `file_path`. No changes needed to the wire protocol.

**SaveData for Artifact**: `_save_artifact()` copies the file via `shutil.copy2()`. This is correct behavior — it copies the file to the user-chosen path, not to managed storage.

#### D6. `get_in_memory_data()` per-class behavior

The current `get_in_memory_data()` on `DataObject` uses `hasattr` to check for undeclared attributes. This is replaced with a clean per-class dispatch:

**DataObject (base class):**
```python
def get_in_memory_data(self) -> Any:
    """Materialize data from storage for persistence/export."""
    return self.to_memory()  # storage_ref → backend → read
```

**Per-class overrides:**

| Class | `get_in_memory_data()` behavior | Rationale |
|-------|-------------------------------|-----------|
| **DataObject** (base) | `return self.to_memory()` | Default: read from storage via backend. |
| **Array** | Inherited from DataObject | `to_memory()` → ZarrBackend.read() → `np.ndarray` |
| **DataFrame** | Inherited from DataObject | `to_memory()` → ArrowBackend.read() → `pyarrow.Table` |
| **Series** | Inherited from DataObject | `to_memory()` → ArrowBackend.read() → `pyarrow.Table` (single column) |
| **Text** (override) | `return self.content` | Text content is in-memory by design (~KB). No storage round-trip needed. |
| **Artifact** (override) | `return self.file_path.read_bytes()` | Reads from original file. Not from managed storage. |
| **CompositeData** | Inherited from DataObject | `to_memory()` → CompositeStore.read() → reconstructs slot dict |

**Removed**: The `hasattr(self, "_data")` and `hasattr(self, "_arrow_table")` checks in the base class. No monkey-patched attributes are consulted.

This means SaveData's `_save_array()`, `_save_dataframe()`, etc. all work correctly with storage-backed objects — they call `get_in_memory_data()` → `to_memory()` → backend read.

#### D7. Worker reconstruction contract (restated from ADR-027 Add1)

`worker.reconstruct_inputs()` returns **typed DataObject instances** (e.g., `Image`, `DataFrame`), not `ViewProxy`. This decision from ADR-027 Addendum 1 is **correct and retained**.

The reconstruction hooks remain:
- `cls._reconstruct_extra_kwargs(metadata)` — per-base-class kwargs extraction
- `cls._serialise_extra_metadata(obj)` — per-base-class metadata serialization

The Meta Pydantic constraints remain:
- Frozen, no `PrivateAttr`, all fields must round-trip through `model_dump_json` / `model_validate_json`

#### D8. Checkpoint deserialization updated

`checkpoint.py`'s `deserialize_intermediate_refs()` currently constructs `ViewProxy` instances. This function is rewritten to construct typed `DataObject` instances using the same `_reconstruct_one()` path as the worker.

If type resolution fails (missing plugin), fall back to a base `DataObject(storage_ref=ref)` rather than a `ViewProxy`.

#### D9. Documentation is unified

All references to the old "engine injects ViewProxy" model are removed from:
- `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md:331-362` (and line 618)
- `docs/adr/ADR.md` ADR-007 discussion text
- Block SDK guide

The canonical documentation model is:
- Blocks receive **typed DataObject instances** with `storage_ref` set
- Data is lazy — `to_memory()` / `sel()` / `iter_chunks()` trigger reads on demand
- ViewProxy does not exist

| Rewrite `sel(**kwargs)` | Remove `hasattr(self, "_data")` check (line 214). Always read from storage: `full_data = self.to_memory()`. Persist slice result to temp zarr with `storage_ref` instead of stashing in `_data`. |
| Rewrite `iter_over(axis)` | Delegates to `sel()` per-index — inherits sel()'s storage-based behavior. |
| `__array__()` | No change — already calls `self.to_memory()`. |
| `shape`, `axes`, `dtype` | No change — already declared constructor parameters. |

**DataFrame subclass** (`src/scieasy/core/types/dataframe.py`):

| Change | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| No `_arrow_table` attribute | All data access through inherited `to_memory()` → ArrowBackend |

**Text subclass** (`src/scieasy/core/types/text.py`):

| Change | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| `get_in_memory_data()` override | Returns `self.content`. No storage round-trip. (Existing behavior, no change.) |

**Artifact subclass** (`src/scieasy/core/types/artifact.py`):

| Change | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| `get_in_memory_data()` override | Returns `self.file_path.read_bytes()`. (Existing behavior, no change.) |
| Exempt from auto-flush | See D5. |

**CompositeData** (`src/scieasy/core/types/composite.py`):

| Change | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Per-slot compliance | Each slot is an independent DataObject — follows its own class's contract. CompositeStore handles recursive persistence. |

#### 4.3 IOBlock and loader changes

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `src/scieasy/blocks/io/io_block.py` | Change `load()` signature to `load(self, config, output_dir)`. Add `persist_array()` and `persist_table()` helper methods. Update `run()` to pass `output_dir` and auto-flush any item without `storage_ref` (D4 safety net). |
| `src/scieasy/blocks/io/loaders/load_data.py` | Update `load()` to accept `output_dir`. Per-function changes: `_load_array .zarr` (already lazy, no change). `_load_array .npy/.npz/.parquet` (simple path — base class auto-flushes). `_load_dataframe` (simple or streaming — author's choice). `_load_series` (fix payload loss — must write to arrow). `_load_text` (simple path). `_load_artifact` (exempt, path-only D5). `_load_composite_data` (recursive, pass output_dir). |
| `packages/scieasy-blocks-imaging/.../load_image.py` | Streaming path for `_load_tiff` (page-by-page via `persist_array()`). `_load_zarr` (reference existing zarr store, no copy). |
| `packages/scieasy-blocks-lcms/.../load_mzml_files.py` | Update `load()` signature. MSRawFile is Artifact subclass — path-only, exempt. |
| `packages/scieasy-blocks-lcms/.../load_peak_table.py` | Fix: write DataFrame to arrow via `persist_table()`, remove pandas from `user` dict. |
| `packages/scieasy-blocks-lcms/.../load_mid_table.py` | Update `load()` signature, use simple or streaming path. |
| `packages/scieasy-blocks-lcms/.../load_sample_metadata.py` | Update `load()` signature, use simple path. |
| `src/scieasy/blocks/io/savers/save_data.py` | Remove `_arrow_table` check. Phase 3: add chunked export for Parquet/CSV/Zarr. |
| `packages/scieasy-blocks-imaging/.../save_image.py` | No immediate change. Phase 3: add chunked TIFF write. |
| `packages/scieasy-blocks-lcms/.../save_table.py` | Update `save()` to use `get_in_memory_data()` consistently. |

#### 4.4 Block framework changes

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `src/scieasy/blocks/base/block.py` | Remove `_is_view_proxy()` helper. Update `validate()` to remove ViewProxy branch. Update `_auto_flush()` to skip Artifact (D5). |
| `src/scieasy/blocks/process/process_block.py` | No change — already calls `_auto_flush()` on outputs. |
| `src/scieasy/blocks/process/utils.py` | Remove ViewProxy isinstance check in `to_arrow()`. |
| `src/scieasy/blocks/app/bridge.py` | Remove ViewProxy isinstance check. |
| `src/scieasy/blocks/process/builtins/split.py` | Replace `_arrow_table` assignments with `get_in_memory_data()` + storage write. |
| `src/scieasy/blocks/process/builtins/merge.py` | Same pattern. |

#### 4.5 Engine changes

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `src/scieasy/engine/checkpoint.py` | Rewrite `deserialize_intermediate_refs()` to construct DataObject, not ViewProxy (D8). |
| `src/scieasy/engine/runners/worker.py` | Remove ViewProxy references from docstrings. No structural changes — already returns typed DataObject. |
| `src/scieasy/engine/runners/local.py` | `serialise_inputs()` added by PR #623 (P0 fix) remains as defense-in-depth. |
| `src/scieasy/engine/scheduler.py` | Remove ViewProxy comments. |

#### 4.6 SaveData and saver changes

SaveData is a **sink block** — it reads data from storage and writes to a user-chosen file format.

**Audit finding §2.2.5: SaveData currently cannot reliably export storage-backed objects.** `_save_array()` calls `obj.get_in_memory_data()`, which checks `hasattr(self, "_data")`. A storage-backed Array reconstructed in the worker has `storage_ref` set but no `_data`, so `get_in_memory_data()` raises `ValueError`. The same applies to `_dataframe_to_arrow_table()` which checks for `_arrow_table`.

**This is resolved by D6**: `get_in_memory_data()` is rewritten to route through `to_memory()` → storage backend read. SaveData works correctly with storage-backed objects without SaveData-specific code changes in Phase 1/2.

**Phase 3 optimization**: For large data, SaveData should read from storage chunk-by-chunk and write to the target format incrementally, avoiding full materialization. This is format-dependent — Parquet and Zarr support chunked writes; NPY and CSV do not.

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `src/scieasy/blocks/io/savers/save_data.py` | Phase 1/2: Remove `_arrow_table` check in `_dataframe_to_arrow_table()`. All paths work via `get_in_memory_data()` → `to_memory()` → storage read. Phase 3: Add chunked export paths for formats that support it (Parquet, Zarr). |
| `packages/scieasy-blocks-imaging/.../save_image.py` | Phase 1/2: No change needed — SaveImage calls `to_memory()` which now routes through storage. Phase 3: Add chunked TIFF write (page-by-page from zarr). |

**Per-format SaveData behavior after this ADR:**

| Format | Phase 1/2 (correctness) | Phase 3 (streaming) |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|
| `.zarr` | `get_in_memory_data()` → full read → zarr write | Direct zarr-to-zarr copy (zero materialization) |
| `.npy` | `get_in_memory_data()` → full read → `np.save()` | Full read required (NPY format is not chunked) |
| `.parquet` | `get_in_memory_data()` → full read → `pq.write_table()` | Chunked: read row groups from arrow → write row groups to parquet |
| `.csv` | `get_in_memory_data()` → full read → `write_csv()` | Chunked: read batches from arrow → write batches to CSV |
| TIFF | `get_in_memory_data()` → full read → `tifffile.imwrite()` | Chunked: read z-planes from zarr → write pages to TIFF |

#### 4.7 Utility changes

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `src/scieasy/utils/axis_iter.py` | Replace `result._data = data` with persist-to-zarr + set storage_ref. |
| `src/scieasy/utils/broadcast.py` | Update ViewProxy references in docstrings/warnings. |

#### 4.8 Test changes

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `tests/core/test_proxy.py` | Delete entirely. |
| `tests/core/test_proxy_multi_backend.py` | Delete entirely. |
| `tests/core/test_dataobject_extended.py` | Update: assert `storage_ref is not None` instead of `_data` checks. |
| `tests/core/test_storage.py` | Remove ViewProxy construction. |
| `tests/engine/test_checkpoint.py` | Update: assert DataObject instead of ViewProxy from deserialization. |
| `tests/engine/test_worker.py` | Remove ViewProxy assertion (already asserts `not isinstance(x, ViewProxy)`). |
| `tests/engine/test_worker_typed_reconstruction.py` | Remove ViewProxy imports and negative assertions. |
| `tests/blocks/test_block_base.py` | Remove ViewProxy validation tests. |
| `tests/blocks/test_process_utils.py` | Remove ViewProxy mock. |
| `tests/blocks/io/test_load_data.py` | Update: assert `storage_ref is not None` instead of `_data`/`_arrow_table` checks. |

#### 4.9 Documentation changes

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` | Remove ViewProxy-injection model (lines 331-362, 613-618). Update to DataObject-only model. |
| `docs/adr/ADR.md` (ADR-007) | Add note: "ViewProxy eliminated in ADR-031. Methods absorbed into DataObject." |
| `docs/adr/ADR.md` (ADR-027 Add1) | Mark as ~~deprecated~~ — superseded by ADR-031. |
| `docs/guides/block-sdk.md` | Update data access examples: `item.to_memory()` not `item.view().to_memory()`. |

### 5. Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Loader rewrite + core enforcement (all loaders write to storage directly)

1. **Change `IOBlock.load()` signature** — add `output_dir: str` parameter. Update `IOBlock.run()` to pass `output_dir` and enforce `storage_ref` on returned objects (D4).
2. **Rewrite all 6 loader classes (~12 functions)** to write directly to zarr/arrow storage and return reference-only DataObjects. Use streaming writes where the format supports it (TIFF page-by-page, CSV Arrow streaming, etc.).
3. **Artifact auto-flush skip** (D5) — `_auto_flush()` skips Artifact with `file_path`.
4. **Fix `_load_series()` payload loss** — write to arrow backend, return with `storage_ref`.
5. **Fix `LoadPeakTable` user-dict violation** — write DataFrame to arrow storage, not `user` dict.
6. **Update test fixtures** — mock loaders in `tests/` must comply with new `load()` signature.

#### Phase 2: ViewProxy elimination and `_data` cleanup

7. **Move `_get_backend()` and data access methods to DataObject** — `to_memory()`, `slice()`, `iter_chunks()`. Add 2GB size warning.
8. **Delete `ViewProxy` class** (`src/scieasy/core/proxy.py`) and `DataObject.view()` method.
9. **Rewrite `get_in_memory_data()`** — route through `to_memory()`, remove `hasattr(self, "_data")` / `_arrow_table` checks (D6).
10. **Update `Array.to_memory()`** — remove `_data` backdoor, always read from storage.
11. **Update `Array.sel()`** — remove `_data` check, read from storage. Persist slice result to temp zarr with storage_ref (no `_data` stashing).
12. **Update `checkpoint.py`** — `deserialize_intermediate_refs()` constructs typed DataObject, not ViewProxy (D8).
13. **Update `save_data.py`** — remove `_arrow_table` check in `_dataframe_to_arrow_table()`.
14. **Remove all ViewProxy imports, isinstance checks, and helpers** — `block.py:_is_view_proxy()`, `process/utils.py`, `app/bridge.py`, all comments.
15. **Update `split.py`, `merge.py`, `axis_iter.py`** �� replace `_arrow_table`/`_data` assignments with storage writes.
16. **Delete test files** — `test_proxy.py`, `test_proxy_multi_backend.py`. Update all tests asserting `_data` to assert `storage_ref`.

#### Phase 3: Process-side optimization (incremental)

17. **Array.sel() Zarr partial-read** — leverage Zarr backend's native slicing instead of full materialization + numpy indexing.
18. **SaveData streaming export** — for formats that support it, read from zarr chunk-by-chunk, write to target format chunk-by-chunk.
19. **Block SDK guidance** — document `iter_chunks()` / `sel()` as preferred over `to_memory()` for large data. Add framework-level memory warning when `to_memory()` on large data.

### 6. Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Performance regression from format conversion** — loaders convert source format (TIFF/CSV/etc.) to zarr/arrow; downstream reads from zarr/arrow, SaveData converts back to target format | Medium | This is inherent to using zarr as universal intermediate format. Streaming writes minimize memory. For workflows where source and target format match, a future "passthrough" optimization can skip intermediate storage. |
| **Existing plugin blocks break** — blocks that set `_data` directly | Low | D4 enforcement is backward-compatible — it flushes `_data` objects to zarr automatically. Blocks don't need to change immediately. |
| **`Array.sel()` becomes slower** — currently reads from `_data` (in-memory), will read from zarr | Medium | Zarr partial-read (Phase 4) mitigates this. For small arrays, the overhead is negligible. |
| **Test breakage** — many tests assert `_data` presence | Low | Systematic update: assert `storage_ref is not None` instead. |
| **Checkpoint backward compatibility** — old checkpoints may have ViewProxy-format entries | Low | `deserialize_intermediate_refs()` rewritten to produce DataObject. Old wire format still parseable. |

---

### 7. Alternatives Considered

1. **Keep ViewProxy as opt-in helper (ADR-027 Add1 approach).** Rejected — no block uses it. Maintaining a class with zero consumers adds complexity without value.

2. **Keep `_data` but enforce it's always backed by storage_ref too.** Rejected — two sources of truth for the same data. Which wins when they disagree? The `_data` pattern invites bypass of the storage contract.

3. **Create per-format read-only backends (TiffBackend, NpyBackend, etc.) for true zero-copy lazy loading.** Deferred — not rejected, but not required for this ADR. Zarr as the universal intermediate format is sufficient. Per-format backends can be added incrementally when performance requires it.

4. **Make DataObject.to_memory() check `_data` first as fast-path cache.** Rejected — this is the existing backdoor that caused the regression. A single code path (storage_ref → backend → read) is simpler, more predictable, and debuggable.

---

### 8. Consequences

- **DataObject becomes the single, unambiguous data abstraction.** No ViewProxy, no `_data` backdoor, no dual code paths.
- **All loaders become compliant immediately** via D4 (IOBlock enforcement), without individual loader code changes.
- **SaveData works with storage-backed objects** because `get_in_memory_data()` routes through `to_memory()`.
- **100G+ data support becomes architecturally possible** once Phase 3 (streaming loaders) is implemented. Phase 1 alone does not solve the OOM problem but removes the architectural barriers to solving it.
- **The wire protocol is unchanged.** JSON payload format between scheduler and worker is not modified.
- **56+ code locations require updates** across 19 source files. The changes are mechanical (remove ViewProxy imports, remove `_data` checks, update assertions) except for the IOBlock enforcement (D4) and the `to_memory()` rewrite.
- **ADR-027 Addendum 1 is formally deprecated.** Its correct decisions (typed reconstruction, per-class hooks, Meta constraints) are restated in D7.

### Appendix A: Deprecated ADR-027 Addendum 1

**Status**: ~~proposed~~ → **deprecated (superseded by ADR-031)**

ADR-027 Addendum 1 ("Worker subprocess type reconstruction returns typed DataObject instances, not ViewProxy") is deprecated in its entirety. The following decisions from Addendum 1 are **restated in ADR-031** with updated scope:

| Addendum 1 Decision | ADR-031 Status |
|---|---|
| D11': typed DataObject reconstruction in worker | **Retained** (ADR-031 D7) |
| `_reconstruct_extra_kwargs` / `_serialise_extra_metadata` hooks | **Retained** (ADR-031 D7) |
| Meta Pydantic constraints (frozen, JSON-round-trippable) | **Retained** (ADR-031 D7) |
| ViewProxy "demoted to opt-in helper via `item.view()`" | **Rejected** — ViewProxy deleted entirely (ADR-031 D2) |
| PhysicalQuantity Pydantic integration via `__get_pydantic_core_schema__` | **Retained** — unchanged, not in scope of ADR-031 |

References to ADR-027 Addendum 1 in code comments should be updated to cite ADR-031 D7 for reconstruction contract and ADR-031 D2 for ViewProxy elimination.

### Appendix B: Audit Report Reference

This ADR was motivated by the independent data storage and transport audit documented in `docs/data-storage-transport-audit.en.md` (2026-04-11). Key audit findings are cited in §2.2 with evidence references to specific source files and line numbers.

The audit's summary:

> SciEasy's transport layer is mostly reference-based now, but its load, processing, and export layers still contain widespread eager materialization, payload-loss edge cases, and multiple mismatches with the stated design philosophy.
