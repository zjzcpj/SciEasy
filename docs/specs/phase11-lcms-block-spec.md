# Phase 11 LC-MS Plugin Block Specification

**Status**: accepted
**Date**: 2026-04-07
**Issue**: #301
**Authoritative ADRs**: ADR-027, ADR-027 Addendum 1, ADR-028, ADR-028 Addendum 1
**Master plan**: `phase11_master_plan.md` §2.4 (LC-MS PLUGIN block list)
**Companion specs**: `phase11-imaging-block-spec.md`, `phase11-srs-block-spec.md`

## 1. Purpose

This document is the **single source of truth** for the implementation of the
`scieasy-blocks-lcms` plugin package. It enumerates the four plugin types,
the ~20 blocks, the package layout, the per-ticket implementation contract,
the open questions resolved during spec authoring, and the integration test
strategy.

Unlike the imaging plugin (which is broad and dimension-rich) or the SRS
plugin (which is a small specialisation of imaging), the LC-MS plugin is
shaped almost entirely by **the user's verbatim workflow**:

> 对于 raw 和 mzML、mzXML 文件，我们一般会直接打开 ElMAVEN 处理，因此 load 的时候
> 可以当作一个 artifact 类，然后直接接一个 ElMAVEN 的 AppBlock 打开进行处理。
> 之后我们会用 ElMAVEN 导出 csv 或者 tab 表格。导出的表格我们会导入自己原有的 R
> pipeline 做 Natural isotope correction，之后导出一个 xlsx 文档，这对应一个
> script block。再往后的分析就比较 customize，可以引入常用的代谢组学分析。
> 另外，因为我们做 stable isotope tracing 很多，在 LC-MS 包里面加入一些支持
> isotope tracing 的模块是比较有用的。

In English:

1. Raw `.mzML` / `.mzXML` / `.raw` / `.d` files are opened directly in **ElMAVEN**
   (an interactive desktop GUI). The plugin treats raw files as `Artifact` only
   — it never parses scan-level data.
2. ElMAVEN exports CSV/TSV/XLSX peak tables.
3. Peak tables flow into the user's existing **AccuCor R pipeline** for natural
   isotope correction; the output is a **MID table in long format**.
4. Downstream analysis is dominated by **stable isotope tracing** (the plugin's
   USP) plus general metabolomics (univariate, multivariate, pathway, consumption /
   secretion).
5. Final figure polishing happens in **GraphPad Prism** (another AppBlock).

The plugin is therefore designed around **table-shaped DataFrames flowing
through Python**, with two AppBlocks (`ElMAVENBlock`, `GraphPadBlock`) and one
CodeBlock-R (`AccuCorR`) bridging the external tools the user already depends
on. The plugin's USP is **stable isotope tracing**, which is why §9 dedicates
the most detailed per-ticket sections to the isotope tracing block group.

## 2. Scope

**In scope**: design contract for the `scieasy-blocks-lcms` plugin package,
covering 4 types and ~20 blocks across IO, external tools, isotope tracing,
metabolomics analysis, and external plotting. One PR per ticket. The recommended
PR order is a stacked sequence per the dependency graph in §4.

**Out of scope**:

- The two sibling specs (`phase11-imaging-block-spec.md`,
  `phase11-srs-block-spec.md`) — independent agents and PRs.
- Core type system, scheduler, worker subprocess (Phase 10, already merged).
- ADR text — ADR-027 / ADR-028 / their Addenda are already merged.
- The bundled AccuCor R script source code itself — only the *contract* for
  shipping it as package data is specified here. The actual R code lives in
  the implementation ticket (T-LCMS-007).
- The `scieasy-blocks-imaging` and `scieasy-blocks-srs` plugins.

**Forbidden** (these would be scope violations per the master plan §2.4 lock):

- `MSSpectrum(Series)` — the user explicitly rejected scan-level types.
- `MSRun(Array)` — same.
- `EnumerateIsotopologues`, `MatchIsotopologues`, `ComputeMID`,
  `AtomPercentExcess`, `TimeCourseFit`, `TracerFateMap` — AccuCor R does all
  of this externally.
- QC blocks (`QCDriftCheck`, `QCRecovery`, `ReportQC`) — user removed.
- `ManualReview` blocks — user said "我 GUI 右边的 viewer 栏点 block 就能看见".
- `MZmineProcess`, `XCMSRun` — user said "先实现 ElMAVEN".
- Full 13C-MFA — user said "full 13C-MFA 太重". `FluxEstimate` is a simple
  steady-state estimate only.
- Wide-format MID as the canonical shape — AccuCor produces long, the user's
  workflow uses long.

T-LCMS-001 is the foundation: nothing else can land without the package
scaffold. T-LCMS-002 (types) is the prerequisite for every IO and analysis
ticket because every block accepts/returns one of the four plugin types.
T-LCMS-003 / T-LCMS-004 / T-LCMS-005 are independent of each other and can
land in any order after T-LCMS-002. T-LCMS-006 stacks on T-LCMS-004 (only so
its tests can use a real PeakTable fixture). T-LCMS-007 (the two external
tools) depends on T-LCMS-003 + T-LCMS-004 + T-LCMS-006. T-LCMS-008 through
T-LCMS-018 are the analysis tickets and stack in the order shown. T-LCMS-019
(GraphPadBlock) is independent of the analysis chain — it can land any time
after T-LCMS-001 + T-LCMS-002. T-LCMS-020 stacks on every preceding ticket
(it registers them all). T-LCMS-021 stacks on T-LCMS-020.

## 5. Recommended PR order

The recommended linear order, where each PR's base is the previous PR's
branch (stacked PRs):

1. **T-LCMS-001** — plugin scaffold + pyproject (independent, small)
2. **T-LCMS-002** — types module (4 classes)
3. **T-LCMS-003** — `LoadMSRawFiles`
4. **T-LCMS-004** — `LoadPeakTable`
5. **T-LCMS-005** — `LoadMIDTable`
6. **T-LCMS-006** — `LoadSampleMetadata` + `SaveTable`
7. **T-LCMS-007** — `ElMAVENBlock` + `AccuCorR` (the two external tools)
8. **T-LCMS-008** — `Calculate13CEnrichment` (start of the USP cluster)
9. **T-LCMS-009** — `FractionalLabeling`
10. **T-LCMS-010** — `CompareGroupMID`
11. **T-LCMS-011** — `FluxEstimate`
12. **T-LCMS-012** — `PoolSizeNormalize`
13. **T-LCMS-013** — `MetaboliteMatrix` (start of the metabolomics cluster)
14. **T-LCMS-014** — `MatrixPreprocess`
15. **T-LCMS-015** — `UnivariateStats`
16. **T-LCMS-016** — `MultivariateAnalysis`
17. **T-LCMS-017** — `PathwayEnrichment`
18. **T-LCMS-018** — `ConsumptionSecretionAnalysis`
19. **T-LCMS-019** — `GraphPadBlock`
20. **T-LCMS-020** — entry-point registration + plugin smoke test
21. **T-LCMS-021** — isotope tracing integration test

If parallel work is desired, T-LCMS-003 / T-LCMS-004 / T-LCMS-005 can be
opened simultaneously off T-LCMS-002. T-LCMS-019 (GraphPadBlock) can be
opened in parallel with the analysis cluster — it touches a different
sub-package.

The two external-tool tickets (T-LCMS-007's `ElMAVENBlock` and `AccuCorR`)
are deliberately bundled into a single ticket because they share the
"external tool wrapper" architectural pattern and because the implementation
agent needs to think about both `app_command` validation and R-runner
integration in the same head-space. Splitting them would create two PRs that
review identically.

## 6. Universal rules for all LC-MS implementation agents

These rules apply to **every** ticket in this document. Failure to follow
them is a workflow gate violation per `CLAUDE.md` Appendix A.

1. **Workflow gate is mandatory** — every ticket follows the full 6-stage
   workflow gate. No exceptions for "small" tickets. Each stage must show
   `[DONE]` in `python .workflow/gate.py status <task_id>` before the next
   stage begins.
2. **Branch naming**: `feat/issue-N/T-LCMS-NNN-short-name`. Example for
   T-LCMS-008: `feat/issue-NNN/T-LCMS-008-calc-13c-enrichment`.
3. **Stacked PR base** — each PR's base branch is the previous merged PR's
   branch (so the diffs compose cleanly). If the previous PR has already
   merged into `main`, base off `main` directly. Mark stacked PRs with the
   previous PR number in the description.
4. **Out-of-scope changes are forbidden** — the PR's diff must contain only
   files listed in the ticket's "Files to be created", "Files to be
   modified", "New tests", and "Existing tests to update" sections. Any
   other modified file is a scope violation per `CLAUDE.md` §6.7. Tests for
   in-scope source files are always in-scope.
5. **Plugin layout discipline**: every plugin source file lives under
   `packages/scieasy-blocks-lcms/src/scieasy_blocks_lcms/`. Tests live under
   `packages/scieasy-blocks-lcms/tests/`. The plugin MUST NOT add files
   under `src/scieasy/` (the core repo path). If an implementation agent
   discovers a missing core capability, they file a *new core issue* and
   block on it — never patch core inside a plugin PR.
6. **Every check must be green before review**:
   - `pytest -x --no-cov packages/scieasy-blocks-lcms/tests/` passes
     locally.
   - `ruff check packages/scieasy-blocks-lcms/` clean.
   - `ruff format --check packages/scieasy-blocks-lcms/` clean.
   - `mypy packages/scieasy-blocks-lcms/src --ignore-missing-imports`
     clean.
   - The core repo's `python -m importlinter --config pyproject.toml`
     contract is unchanged (plugins do not import from core internals).
7. **CHANGELOG.md** must be updated under `[Unreleased]` in the appropriate
   section (`Added` / `Changed` / `Fixed`) with full attribution per
   `CLAUDE.md` Appendix A Stage 6:
   `[#N] Description (@claude, YYYY-MM-DD, branch: ..., session: ...)`.
8. **PR body must reference**:
   - The relevant master plan section (e.g. "Per master plan §2.4 LC-MS
     PLUGIN — isotope tracing").
   - The ticket ID from this spec (e.g. "Per
     `docs/specs/phase11-lcms-block-spec.md` T-LCMS-008").
   - The previous PR in the stack (if any).
   - A reproduction of the ticket's acceptance criteria as a checklist
     with each box ticked when satisfied.
9. **No silent scope expansion** — if implementing a ticket reveals a
   pre-existing bug or design ambiguity, open a *new issue* describing it.
   Do not fix it inline. Per `CLAUDE.md` §9.2 ("Claude must not silently
   broaden scope") and Appendix C Step 3.
10. **No type relaxation to pass tests** — per master plan §5 "Audit Agent
    Scope Violation Detection". If a test fails because the spec requires
    handling `MIDTable` and the implementation only handles `DataFrame`,
    the fix is to handle `MIDTable`, NOT to weaken the test to accept
    `DataFrame`. Audit agents will explicitly check for this anti-pattern.
11. **External tool blocks (T-LCMS-007, T-LCMS-019)** must mark their
    integration tests with the correct pytest markers
    (`@pytest.mark.requires_elmaven`, `@pytest.mark.requires_r`,
    `@pytest.mark.requires_graphpad`) and register them under
    `[tool.pytest.ini_options].markers` in the plugin's `pyproject.toml`
    so CI skips them when the external dependency is absent.
12. **The bundled AccuCor R script** is package data, not source code.
    It lives at `src/scieasy_blocks_lcms/scripts/accucor_default.R` and is
    declared in `pyproject.toml` `[tool.setuptools.package-data]`. The
    `AccuCorR` block resolves the script path via `importlib.resources`,
    not via filesystem traversal.

## 7. Universal acceptance criteria (apply to ALL LC-MS tickets)

In addition to each ticket's own acceptance criteria, every ticket must
satisfy these:

1. The PR's diff includes ONLY files listed in "Files to be created",
   "Files to be modified", "New tests", and "Existing tests to update" for
   that ticket. Any other modified file is a scope violation.
2. `pytest -x --no-cov packages/scieasy-blocks-lcms/tests/` passes
   locally before push.
3. `ruff check packages/scieasy-blocks-lcms/` clean.
4. `ruff format --check packages/scieasy-blocks-lcms/` clean.
5. `mypy packages/scieasy-blocks-lcms/src --ignore-missing-imports` clean.
6. Importlinter contract unchanged on the core repo.
7. `CHANGELOG.md` has an entry under `[Unreleased]` in the appropriate
   section with full attribution per `CLAUDE.md` Appendix A Stage 6.
8. Workflow gate has all 6 stages `[DONE]`.
9. PR body explicitly references which master plan section it implements
   and links to this spec by ticket ID.
10. PR body reproduces the ticket's per-ticket acceptance criteria as a
    checklist with each item ticked.
11. CI is green on the PR before requesting review.
12. No new core types are introduced (every plugin type subclasses one of
    the seven Phase 10 core types: `DataObject`, `Array`, `Series`,
    `DataFrame`, `Text`, `Artifact`, `CompositeData`).

## 8. Open questions resolved by this document

These are decisions made in this document that go *beyond* the master plan
§2.4 block list. The master plan deferred them to spec authoring; this
section records the resolution so subsequent implementation agents do not
have to re-litigate.

### Q-1: AccuCor R script bundling — vendored vs. external dependency?

The user's existing R pipeline uses the **AccuCor R package**
([`https://github.com/lparsons/accucor`](https://github.com/lparsons/accucor),
authored by Xiaojing Huang and Lance Parsons at Princeton). The user pipes
ElMAVEN-exported peak tables through their *own* R script that calls
`accucor::natural_abundance_correction()`.

**Decision**: the `AccuCorR` block ships a **default AccuCor R driver
script** as package data at
`packages/scieasy-blocks-lcms/src/scieasy_blocks_lcms/scripts/accucor_default.R`,
and accepts a user override via the `accucor_script_path: str | None`
config field.

The default driver script:

- Loads the AccuCor R package (`library(accucor)`).
- Reads the input PeakTable (CSV/TSV/XLSX) from the path the block writes
  to the exchange directory.
- Reads the SampleMetadata from the same exchange directory.
- Calls `accucor::natural_abundance_correction(...)` with the
  `tracer_formula` and `resolution` config fields.
- Writes the corrected MID table (long format) to the output directory.

**Versioning**: the bundled script is pinned to AccuCor v0.3.1 (the latest
stable release as of spec authoring, 2026-04-07). The implementation
ticket (T-LCMS-007) records the upstream commit SHA in a comment at the
top of `accucor_default.R`. The `accucor` R package is **not** auto-installed
by the plugin (R packages cannot be installed via pip); the plugin's
README documents the prerequisite (`install.packages("accucor")`).

**License**: AccuCor is MIT-licensed; the upstream LICENSE is reproduced
verbatim in `packages/scieasy-blocks-lcms/THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md` per the
implementation ticket T-LCMS-007.

**Why not just call AccuCor directly via `rpy2`?** Because `rpy2` carries a
heavy install footprint, fights with conda environments, and breaks on
Windows + R combinations. The `CodeBlock(language="r")` runner already
spawns a real `Rscript` subprocess (per ADR-017), so we get the same effect
with less complexity.

### Q-2: ElMAVEN GUI interaction — script the UI or wait for the user?

ElMAVEN is a desktop GUI application (Qt-based). It exposes some
command-line flags but is fundamentally interactive: the user opens the
peak table view, picks compounds, sets RT windows, and exports manually.

**Decision**: the `ElMAVENBlock` does **not** try to script ElMAVEN. It
follows the existing `AppBlock` file-exchange pattern:

1. Block copies the input `Collection[MSRawFile]` paths into
   `<exchange_dir>/inputs/` (or just records their paths in a manifest
   file — see implementation note in T-LCMS-007).
2. Block launches ElMAVEN via `subprocess.Popen` (the `app_command` is
   `elmaven` by default; the user may override via config).
3. Block transitions to `PAUSED` state (per ADR-018) and the
   `FileWatcher` watches `<exchange_dir>/outputs/` for files matching
   `*.csv`, `*.tsv`, `*.xlsx`.
4. The user drives ElMAVEN manually: opens the input files, runs peak
   detection, and uses ElMAVEN's `Export → Spreadsheet` to write CSV/TSV/XLSX
   into the watched output directory.
5. When the watcher detects stable files (per the standard
   `stability_period`), the block transitions back to `RUNNING`, parses
   the exported file as a `PeakTable`, and returns it.

**Timeout**: the `watch_timeout` defaults to **1800 seconds** (30 minutes)
because ElMAVEN sessions are slow and the user may need to inspect many
compounds. This is overridable via config.

**MID export**: ElMAVEN can also export a MID-shaped table directly (its
`isotope` view). The block treats `*.csv` / `*.tsv` / `*.xlsx` files in
the output directory uniformly: if the user exports both a peak table and
a MID table, the block returns both via separate output ports. See

### Q-3: MID long format vs wide format — which is canonical?

AccuCor R output is **long format**: one row per compound × isotopologue
combination, sample columns wide. The user's verbatim example:

```
Compound    C13    H2    UL0    UL3    UL2    UL1    SE3
cytosine    0      0     1      1      0.9995 1      0.9542
cytosine    1      0     0      0      0      0      0.0029
```

**Decision**: `MIDTable` is **always long format**. `LoadMIDTable` preserves
this layout. `Calculate13CEnrichment`, `FractionalLabeling`,
`CompareGroupMID`, and `FluxEstimate` all consume long format.

If a user wants wide format (e.g. for plotting in GraphPad), they can:

- Use `MetaboliteMatrix` (the metabolomics block) to pivot
  PeakTable → wide.
- Use a generic `CodeBlock(language="python")` with one line of pandas:
  `df.pivot_table(index="Compound", columns="sample", values="C13")`.

**Why long?** Three reasons:

1. AccuCor produces it, and the entire downstream pipeline already speaks
   long format. Forcing a wide pivot inside `LoadMIDTable` would make the
   block's input round-trip lossy (different column orders).
2. Long format scales better when `tracer_atoms` has more than one element
   (e.g. dual `C13 + H2` labelling); wide format would require a
   multi-index column header.
3. The `groupby` patterns in every analysis block are simpler on long.

### Q-4: How does `LoadMIDTable` detect sample columns?

AccuCor MID output has three column categories:

- **Identity columns**: `Compound` (always present), and sometimes
  `formula`, `mz`, `rt` (passed through from the source PeakTable).
- **Isotope atom-count columns**: integers, named after the tracer atom
  (`C13`, `H2`, `N15`, `O18`, `D`, etc.). One row's value in each
  isotope column is the count of that isotope in this isotopologue.
- **Sample columns**: the abundance values per sample (`UL0`, `UL3`,
  `SE3`, etc. in the user's example). These are floats, named arbitrarily
  by the user's experimental design.

**Decision**: `LoadMIDTable` uses a **two-step heuristic**:

1. Drop a known set of identity column names: `Compound`, `compound`,
   `formula`, `mz`, `rt`, `RT`, `m/z`, `Adduct`, `name`, `Name`. (The set
   is exposed as a constant `_KNOWN_IDENTITY_COLUMNS` in
   `load_mid_table.py`.)
2. From the remaining columns, classify based on the `tracer_atoms` config
   field: any column whose name appears in `tracer_atoms` (case-insensitive)
   is an isotope-count column. Everything else is a sample column.

The user can override this via the `sample_column_pattern: str | None`
config field, which takes a Python regex; if set, only columns matching
the regex are treated as sample columns.

**Example**: with `tracer_atoms=["C13"]` and the user's verbatim sample,
the heuristic correctly identifies:

- Identity: `Compound`
- Isotope: `C13`, `H2` (because `H2` is in the column set; even though
  it isn't in `tracer_atoms`, `LoadMIDTable` treats *known atom names* as
  isotope columns by default — see the `_KNOWN_ATOM_COLUMNS` constant
  in `load_mid_table.py`)
- Sample: `UL0`, `UL3`, `UL2`, `UL1`, `SE3`

The constant `_KNOWN_ATOM_COLUMNS` is `{"C13", "H2", "N15", "O18", "D",
"S34", "Cl37"}` — the seven stable isotopes typically tracked in
metabolomics.

### Q-5: Tracer atom handling — single vs multi-tracer support

The default tracer is `C13` (the `Calculate13CEnrichment` block name
reflects this is the dominant case). But the user has indicated they
sometimes do dual labelling (`C13 + H2`).

**Decision**: `MIDTable.Meta.tracer_atoms` is a `list[str]` (not a single
string), defaulting to `["C13"]`. `LoadMIDTable.tracer_atoms` config field
defaults to `["C13"]` and accepts multi-element lists.

`Calculate13CEnrichment` treats the multi-tracer case as follows:

- If `tracer_atoms == ["C13"]`: standard weighted-average enrichment over
  the `C13` isotope-count column. Result: one row per compound × sample
  with column `enrichment`.
- If `tracer_atoms == ["C13", "H2"]`: per-tracer enrichment is computed
  separately, weighting by the corresponding isotope-count column. Result:
  one row per compound × sample with columns `enrichment_C13`,
  `enrichment_H2`.

The block name remains `Calculate13CEnrichment` even though it supports
multi-tracer because:

1. The user's primary use case is single 13C tracer.
2. Naming the block `CalculateEnrichment` would lose the connection to the
   dominant case.
3. The implementation's branching is a single `if len(tracer_atoms) == 1`
   inside `process()`; not worth a separate block.

### Q-6: PathwayEnrichment — Python-native KEGG REST or R wrapper?

The master plan §2.4 metabolomics list says: "PathwayEnrichment
(CodeBlock R wrapping MetaboAnalystR OR native Python)". This needs a
default-pick decision.

**Decision**: the **default implementation is Python-native** via the KEGG
REST API. Specifically:

- The block is a `ProcessBlock` (not a `CodeBlock`), and lives at
  `packages/scieasy-blocks-lcms/src/scieasy_blocks_lcms/metabolomics/pathway.py`.
- It depends on `requests>=2.31` (already declared in `pyproject.toml`).
- The KEGG REST endpoints used: `https://rest.kegg.jp/link/pathway/cpd`
  (compound → pathway map) and `https://rest.kegg.jp/list/pathway/{org}`
  (organism-specific pathway list, default `hsa` for human).
- Compound IDs are matched on KEGG compound names (the simplest case);
  more advanced ID mapping (HMDB → KEGG, etc.) is a follow-up feature.
- A simple Fisher's exact test gives the per-pathway p-value;
  multiple-testing correction is BH (FDR) by default.
- KEGG responses are cached for the duration of a single block run via a
  process-local `dict`. Persistent caching is a follow-up feature.

The MetaboAnalystR R wrapper is **deferred** to a follow-up feature
ticket (post-0.1.0) tracked as a comment in `pathway.py` and reproduced
in §11 of this spec. The implementation pattern is straightforward
(use `CodeBlock(language="r")` with a hardcoded R script that calls
`MetaboAnalystR::SearchHMDB(...)` etc.) but the install footprint is
heavy and the user has already indicated KEGG REST is sufficient for
0.1.0.

**Why KEGG over MetaboAnalystR for the default?**

1. No R dependency for users who just want a quick enrichment.
2. KEGG REST is free and stable (no API key required).
3. The Python implementation is ~150 lines including tests; the R wrapper
   would be ~80 lines but with a 1-2 GB MetaboAnalystR install.
4. The user's metabolomics workflow already lives in R (via AccuCor); a
   pure-Python alternative gives them an option that doesn't reintroduce
   R for a small downstream step.

### Q-7: ConsumptionSecretionAnalysis — cell count normalization formula

The user described the use case: "spent media vs fresh media for cell
culture extracellular flux", with optional per-cell normalization.

**Decision**: `ConsumptionSecretionAnalysis` accepts:

- `spent_media: PeakTable` (intensity in spent media samples)
- `fresh_media: PeakTable` (intensity in fresh media controls)
- `cell_count_table: DataFrame | None` (optional, per-sample cell counts)

Config:

- `time_hours: float` (culture duration in hours; required)
- `normalize_per_cell: bool = False`
- `intensity_column: str = "intensity"`

Output (long format `DataFrame`):

| Column                  | Type    | Notes                                          |
|-------------------------|---------|------------------------------------------------|
| `compound`              | str     | Compound name (joined from `spent_media`)     |
| `sample`                | str     | Sample ID                                      |
| `delta_concentration`   | float   | `spent[c, s] - fresh[c, s]`                    |
| `consumed_or_secreted`  | str     | `"consumed"` if delta < 0, `"secreted"` if > 0 |
| `flux_per_cell_per_hour`| float   | populated only if `cell_count_table is not None` |

Formula when `normalize_per_cell = True`:

```
flux[c, s] = (spent[c, s] - fresh[c, s]) / (cell_count[s] * time_hours)
```

Formula when `normalize_per_cell = False`:

```
flux[c, s] = (spent[c, s] - fresh[c, s]) / time_hours
```

The fresh media table is matched to the spent media table by **compound
name**, not by sample. (Fresh media has its own samples; consumption is
defined per spent-media sample relative to the *mean* of fresh media
samples for that compound.) This is documented in T-LCMS-018 §g.

**Units**: the block does not enforce intensity units. The user is
responsible for ensuring the `spent_media` and `fresh_media` PeakTables
have consistent units (typically µM after calibration). The output
`flux_per_cell_per_hour` carries whatever unit the input intensities had,
divided by `cell_count * hours`.

### Q-8: GraphPad Prism integration — Windows-only?

GraphPad Prism is primarily a Windows desktop application; macOS builds
exist but cost the same. Linux is unsupported.

**Decision**: `GraphPadBlock` is an `AppBlock` subclass that **logs a
warning** if launched on a non-Windows platform but still attempts the
launch (in case the user has a custom wrapper). The `app_command` has
**no default** because GraphPad's install path varies by version
(`C:\Program Files\GraphPad\Prism 9\Prism.exe` for v9,
`C:\Program Files\GraphPad\Prism 10\Prism.exe` for v10, etc.). The user
must supply `graphpad_path` explicitly via the config.

The block accepts `Collection[DataFrame]` (any DataFrames the user wants
to plot), copies them to `<exchange_dir>/inputs/` as CSV files, optionally
copies a GraphPad template file (`template_path`) to the same directory,
launches GraphPad, and waits for the user to export figures (PNG/PDF/SVG)
to `<exchange_dir>/outputs/`. Output is `Collection[Artifact]` with the
exported figures.

This is the same pattern as `ElMAVENBlock` (T-LCMS-007). The main
difference is that GraphPad's input format is more rigid (CSV with a
specific column layout per template) — see T-LCMS-019 §g.

### Q-9: FluxEstimate vs full 13C-MFA — where is the boundary?

The user explicitly rejected full 13C-MFA: "full 13C-MFA 太重". Tools like
INCA, OpenFLUX, and Metran solve elementary metabolite unit (EMU) systems
to fit fluxes from labelling data — this is heavyweight and external.

**Decision**: `FluxEstimate` provides the **simplest possible** flux
estimate: `flux = labeling_rate × pool_size`, where `labeling_rate` is
the time derivative of fractional labelling estimated from a time-series
MID and `pool_size` is the total compound abundance from the input
PeakTable.

Specifically:

- Input: `MIDTable` (with at least 2 timepoints declared in
  `SampleMetadata.time_hours_column`) + optional `pool_size_table:
  PeakTable`.
- Config: `time_points_column: str` (column in SampleMetadata),
  `group_column: str | None` (optional grouping, e.g. "treatment").
- Output: `DataFrame` with columns `compound`, `group`, `estimated_flux`.

The estimate is a **first-order linear fit** to fractional labelling vs.
time per compound per group. There is no metabolic network, no atom
mapping, no EMU resolution. The block's docstring loudly disclaims that
this is **not a replacement for INCA / OpenFLUX / Metran** and points to
those tools for proper 13C-MFA.

This boundary keeps the block simple (~100 lines), keeps the dependency
list small (just `numpy` for `polyfit`), and matches the user's stated
needs.

### Q-10: Why `LoadMSRawFiles` (plural) and not a single-file variant?

The master plan §2.4 lists `LoadMSRawFiles` (batch loader, returns
`Collection[MSRawFile]`). There is no `LoadMSRawFile` (singular).

**Decision**: there is **no single-file variant**. Single-file loading is
just a `LoadMSRawFiles` configured with `pattern="my_file.mzML"` (i.e. a
glob that matches exactly one file), returning a `Collection` of length
1. This matches the general "collection-first" design of the rest of the
plugin and avoids two near-duplicate blocks in the palette.

The implementation reads minimal header bytes from each file to populate
the `MSRawFile.Meta` fields (`format`, `polarity`, `instrument`,
`acquisition_date`, `sample_id`), but it does not parse scan data. For
`.mzML` and `.mzXML` (XML formats), the first ~8 KB of the file
typically contains the `<msRun>` / `<run>` element with the
`startTimeStamp` and `defaultInstrumentConfigurationRef` attributes. For
`.raw` (Thermo) and `.d` (Bruker), header parsing is much more involved;
the block falls back to filename heuristics and leaves `instrument` as
`None`.

### Q-11: LCMS plugin interaction with ADR-028 Addendum 1 dynamic ports

ADR-028 Addendum 1 introduces `dynamic_ports: ClassVar[dict | None]` and
`get_effective_input_ports() / get_effective_output_ports()` overrides on
the `Block` ABC. These are used by core's `LoadData` / `SaveData` to let
one block produce different output port types based on the `core_type`
config.

**Decision**: **no LC-MS block uses `dynamic_ports`**. Every plugin block
in this spec declares fixed `input_ports` and `output_ports` ClassVars.

Rationale:

- The plugin's types are specific (`MSRawFile`, `PeakTable`, `MIDTable`,
  `SampleMetadata`) — there is no situation where one block can sensibly
  produce *one of N* different types.
- Dynamic ports add GUI complexity (the BlockNode.tsx has to recompute
  port colours when the driving config changes) and the LC-MS workflow
  doesn't benefit from it.
- The four plugin types render via the existing `resolveTypeColor`
  type-hierarchy walk in `BlockNode.tsx`, so the GUI shows distinct
  colours for `MSRawFile` vs `PeakTable` vs `MIDTable` vs `SampleMetadata`
  without any plugin-side frontend work.

### Q-12: Where do plugin blocks live in the GUI palette?

ADR-026 specifies that plugin blocks are auto-discovered from the
`scieasy.blocks` entry-point group at runtime. The frontend palette
groups blocks by their `category: ClassVar[str]` and `package_name`
fields.

**Decision**: every LC-MS block declares `category` from the following
controlled set:

- `"io"` for the 5 IO blocks (T-LCMS-003 .. T-LCMS-006).
- `"app"` for `ElMAVENBlock` and `GraphPadBlock`.
- `"code"` for `AccuCorR`.
- `"process"` for the 5 isotope tracing blocks and the 6 metabolomics
  analysis blocks.

The `package_name` ClassVar is `"scieasy-blocks-lcms"` for all 20 blocks
(set in a base class `_LCMSBlockMixin` to avoid repetition — see
T-LCMS-001).

The palette will render LC-MS blocks under a `scieasy-blocks-lcms` group
with sub-groups by category. No frontend changes are needed for this
plugin.

Each of the 4 classes inherits the base class's `with_meta` /
`_reconstruct_extra_kwargs` / `_serialise_extra_metadata` round-trip
hooks (added in Phase 10 T-013). No subclass override is needed because
the base class handles all the standard slots and the only
plugin-specific data is the `meta` Pydantic model itself.

**h. Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] `MSRawFile` is a subclass of `scieasy.core.types.artifact.Artifact`.
- [ ] `MSRawFile.Meta` is a frozen Pydantic v2 BaseModel with `format`
      required and four optional fields.
- [ ] `PeakTable` is a subclass of `scieasy.core.types.dataframe.DataFrame`.
- [ ] `PeakTable.Meta.source` is required; `polarity` is optional.
- [ ] `MIDTable` is a subclass of `DataFrame`.
- [ ] `MIDTable.Meta.tracer_atoms` defaults to `["C13"]`.
- [ ] `MIDTable.Meta.sample_columns` is required.
- [ ] `MIDTable.Meta.corrected` defaults to `True`.
- [ ] `MIDTable.Meta.correction_tool` defaults to `"AccuCor"`.
- [ ] `SampleMetadata.Meta.sample_id_column` defaults to `"sample_id"`.
- [ ] `get_types()` returns the four classes in registration order.
- [ ] All four classes round-trip through `with_meta(...)` preserving
      the type and the constructor arguments.
- [ ] All four `Meta` classes round-trip through `model_dump_json` /
      `model_validate_json` per the ADR-027 Addendum 1 §3 constraint.
- [ ] **NO `MSSpectrum(Series)` or `MSRun(Array)` is added** — these are
      explicitly forbidden by master plan §2.4 and this spec §2.

**i. Out of scope**:
- Any block that produces or consumes these types (T-LCMS-003+).
- A `LoadMSRawFile` (singular) variant — see §8 Q-10.
- Subclassing `Series` or `Array` — see §2 Forbidden list.

**j. Dependencies on other tickets**: T-LCMS-001 (scaffold).

**k. Estimated diff size**: ~150 lines of source + ~200 lines of test.
Total ~350 lines.

**l. Suggested workflow gate ticket title**:
`LC-MS plugin types module per master plan §2.4 (T-LCMS-002)`

**Status**: Implemented in LCMS foundation chunk 1 (issue #363, PR #369).
`get_types()` now returns the four plugin classes in registration order,
the frozen `Meta` models round-trip through JSON, and the concrete type
tests cover `with_meta(...)` preservation without adding forbidden
scan-level `MSSpectrum` / `MSRun` classes.

**f. Existing tests to update**: none.

**g. Implementation details**:

`LoadPeakTable` is a plain `IOBlock` that reads CSV/TSV/XLSX into a
pandas DataFrame, auto-detects the source tool from column-name
markers, and wraps the result as a `PeakTable`.

Source autodetection signatures:

- **ElMAVEN**: presence of any of `{"compound", "formula", "medMz",
  "medRt", "expectedRtDiff"}`.
- **MZmine**: presence of any of `{"row ID", "row m/z",
  "row retention time"}`.
- **XCMS**: presence of any of `{"mzmed", "rtmed", "mzmin", "mzmax"}`.
- Fallback: ElMAVEN (the user's primary tool).

The pandas DataFrame is cached under `table.user["pandas_df"]` for
downstream blocks that want the materialised frame without a re-read
(non-load-bearing convention; downstream blocks must fall back to
`table.view()` if the key is missing).

**h. Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] `LoadPeakTable` subclasses `IOBlock` and `_LCMSBlockMixin`.
- [ ] `direction == "input"`, `category == "io"`.
- [ ] `output_ports` has a single `peak_table` port with
      `accepted_types=[PeakTable]`.
- [ ] Supports `.csv`, `.tsv`, `.xlsx`, `.xls`.
- [ ] Raises `FileNotFoundError` on missing file, `ValueError` on empty
      table.
- [ ] `source="auto"` correctly detects ElMAVEN / MZmine / XCMS.
- [ ] Output `PeakTable.meta.source` is set.
- [ ] Output `columns` / `row_count` / `schema` match the loaded
      DataFrame.
- [ ] 14 tests pass.

**i. Out of scope**:
- Writing peak tables (`SaveTable`, T-LCMS-006).
- Parsing ElMAVEN project files (`.mzproj`).
- Automatic unit conversion between sources.

**j. Dependencies on other tickets**: T-LCMS-001, T-LCMS-002.

**k. Estimated diff size**: ~200 lines source + ~250 lines test.
Total ~450 lines.

**l. Suggested workflow gate ticket title**:
`LoadPeakTable block per master plan §2.4 (T-LCMS-004)`

**Status**: Implemented in LCMS foundation chunk 1 (issue #363, PR #369).
`LoadPeakTable` now reads CSV / TSV / XLSX / XLS into a cached pandas
frame, auto-detects `ElMAVEN` / `MZmine` / `XCMS` from locked column
signatures, raises on missing or empty inputs, and emits a typed
`PeakTable` with populated `columns`, `row_count`, `schema`, and
`PeakTable.Meta`.

**f. Existing tests to update**: none.

**g. Implementation details**:

Module-level constants:

```python
_KNOWN_IDENTITY_COLUMNS = frozenset({
    "Compound", "compound", "formula", "Formula",
    "mz", "MZ", "m/z",
    "rt", "RT", "retentionTime",
    "Adduct", "adduct", "name", "Name",
})

_KNOWN_ATOM_COLUMNS = frozenset({
    "C13", "H2", "N15", "O18", "D", "S34", "Cl37",
})
```

The sample-column detection function:

```python
def _detect_sample_columns(
    columns: pd.Index,
    *,
    tracer_atoms: list[str],
    pattern: str | None,
) -> list[str]:
    if pattern is not None:
        regex = re.compile(pattern)
        return [c for c in columns if regex.search(str(c))]
    exclude = set(_KNOWN_IDENTITY_COLUMNS) | set(_KNOWN_ATOM_COLUMNS)
    exclude |= set(tracer_atoms)
    return [c for c in columns if c not in exclude]
```

Applied to the user's verbatim example
(`Compound, C13, H2, UL0, UL3, UL2, UL1, SE3`) with `tracer_atoms=["C13"]`,
the default heuristic returns exactly `["UL0", "UL3", "UL2", "UL1", "SE3"]`
because `Compound` is in `_KNOWN_IDENTITY_COLUMNS`, `C13` is in
`_KNOWN_ATOM_COLUMNS` (and also in `tracer_atoms`), and `H2` is in
`_KNOWN_ATOM_COLUMNS`.

The resulting `MIDTable.Meta`:

```python
MIDTable.Meta(
    tracer_atoms=["C13"],
    sample_columns=["UL0", "UL3", "UL2", "UL1", "SE3"],
    corrected=True,
    correction_tool="AccuCor",
)
```

The pandas DataFrame is cached under `table.user["pandas_df"]`.

**h. Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] `LoadMIDTable` subclasses `IOBlock` and `_LCMSBlockMixin`.
- [ ] `category == "io"`, `direction == "input"`.
- [ ] `config_schema` has `path` required; `tracer_atoms` defaulting to
      `["C13"]`; `sample_column_pattern` and `sheet_name` optional.
- [ ] Raises `FileNotFoundError` on missing file, `ValueError` if no
      `Compound`/`compound` column, `ValueError` if no sample columns
      detected.
- [ ] Default heuristic drops `_KNOWN_IDENTITY_COLUMNS` and
      `_KNOWN_ATOM_COLUMNS`.
- [ ] Regex override bypasses the default heuristic.
- [ ] On the user's verbatim example, detected sample columns are
      exactly `["UL0", "UL3", "UL2", "UL1", "SE3"]`.
- [ ] Multi-tracer (`["C13", "H2"]`) round-trips through
      `MIDTable.meta.tracer_atoms`.
- [ ] `MIDTable.meta.corrected == True`,
      `correction_tool == "AccuCor"`.
- [ ] 14 tests pass.

**i. Out of scope**:
- Producing MID tables (`AccuCorR`, T-LCMS-007).
- Validating that per-compound-per-sample MID values sum to 1.0.
- Wide-format loading (see §8 Q-3).

**j. Dependencies on other tickets**: T-LCMS-001, T-LCMS-002.

**k. Estimated diff size**: ~200 lines source + ~280 lines test.
Total ~480 lines.

**l. Suggested workflow gate ticket title**:
`LoadMIDTable block per master plan §2.4 (T-LCMS-005)`

**Status**: Implemented in LCMS foundation chunk 1 (issue #363, PR #369).
`LoadMIDTable` now enforces long-format MID inputs, detects sample
columns via the spec’s identity/tracer exclusion heuristic or regex
override, preserves multi-tracer metadata, raises on missing compound
columns or empty sample detection, and emits `MIDTable.Meta` with
`corrected=True` and `correction_tool="AccuCor"`.

**g. Implementation details**:

`LoadSampleMetadata` mirrors `LoadPeakTable` but wraps as
`SampleMetadata` and exposes `sample_id_column` (default `"sample_id"`)
via config. Raises `ValueError` if the configured sample ID column is
missing from the loaded DataFrame.

`SaveTable` is the generic saver:

- `direction == "output"`.
- Single input port `table` accepting `DataFrame` (covers all four
  subclasses via Liskov).
- `output_ports == []` — sink block.
- Config: `path` (required), `format` (`csv` / `tsv` / `xlsx`, default
  `csv`), `index` (default `False`).
- `save()` creates parent directories, materialises the pandas
  DataFrame via the `table.user["pandas_df"]` cache or falls back to
  `table.view().to_pandas()`, then calls `df.to_csv` / `df.to_excel`
  appropriately.
- Returns `{}` (sink).

**h. Acceptance criteria**:

`LoadSampleMetadata`:
- [ ] Subclasses `IOBlock` and `_LCMSBlockMixin`.
- [ ] `sample_id_column` defaults to `"sample_id"`.
- [ ] Raises `ValueError` on missing configured sample ID column.
- [ ] Output is a `Collection[SampleMetadata]`.
- [ ] 6 tests pass.

`SaveTable`:
- [ ] Subclasses `IOBlock`.
- [ ] Accepts any `DataFrame` subclass via `accepted_types=[DataFrame]`.
- [ ] Supports `csv`, `tsv`, `xlsx`.
- [ ] Creates parent directories if missing.
- [ ] `index` flag respected.

**l. Suggested workflow gate ticket title**:
`LoadSampleMetadata + SaveTable blocks per master plan §2.4 (T-LCMS-006)`

**Status**: Implemented in LCMS foundation chunk 1 (issue #363, PR #369).
`LoadSampleMetadata` now mirrors the table-loading path with a required
configurable sample-ID column, while `SaveTable` writes any
`DataFrame` subclass to CSV / TSV / XLSX, creates parent directories,
respects the `index` flag, and prefers cached pandas frames before
falling back to storage-backed materialisation.

**f. Existing tests to update**: none.

**g. Implementation details**:

`ElMAVENBlock` reuses `AppBlock.run()` verbatim (per ADR-018/ADR-019)
and only specialises:

- `app_command: ClassVar[str] = "elmaven"` (user can override via
  `elmaven_path` config).
- `execution_mode: ClassVar[ExecutionMode] = ExecutionMode.EXTERNAL`.
- `output_patterns: ClassVar[list[str]] = ["*.csv", "*.tsv", "*.xlsx"]`.
- `watch_timeout: ClassVar[int] = 1800` (30 minutes — ElMAVEN is
  interactive and slow).
- `input_ports = [InputPort(name="raw_files",
  accepted_types=[MSRawFile], required=True)]`.
- `output_ports = [OutputPort(name="peak_table",
  accepted_types=[PeakTable]), OutputPort(name="mid_table",
  accepted_types=[MIDTable], required=False)]`.

A module-level classifier routes each exported file to the right output
port:

```python
def _classify_export(path: Path) -> str:
    """Return 'mid_table' if the file looks like a MID table, else 'peak_table'.

    Heuristic: MID tables have a column named 'C13' or 'H2' in the
    header row. Peak tables typically have 'medMz' / 'mz' instead.
    """
    ...
```

Per §8 Q-2, the block does **not** try to script ElMAVEN's UI. The user
opens the input files, runs peak detection, and exports manually via
ElMAVEN's own menus; the `FileWatcher` collects the exports.

`AccuCorR` subclasses `CodeBlock` with `language = "r"` and
`mode = "script"`:

```python
class AccuCorR(_LCMSBlockMixin, CodeBlock):
    language: ClassVar[str] = "r"
    mode: ClassVar[str] = "script"

    input_ports = [
        InputPort(name="peak_table", accepted_types=[PeakTable], required=True),
        InputPort(name="sample_metadata", accepted_types=[SampleMetadata],
                  required=True),
    ]
    output_ports = [OutputPort(name="mid_table", accepted_types=[MIDTable])]

            "resolution": {"type": "integer", "default": 120000},
            "accucor_script_path": {"type": ["string", "null"], "default": None},
        },
    }

    def _resolve_script_path(self, config):
        override = config.get("accucor_script_path")
        if override:
            return str(override)
        with resources.as_file(
            resources.files("scieasy_blocks_lcms.scripts") / "accucor_default.R"
        ) as path:
            return str(path)

    def run(self, inputs, config):
        patched = dict(config)
        patched["script_path"] = self._resolve_script_path(config)
        patched["entry_function"] = "run_accucor"
        patched.setdefault("language", "r")
        patched.setdefault("mode", "script")
        return super().run(inputs, patched)
```

**Status**: Implemented in LCMS foundation chunk 1 (issue #363, PR #369).
`ElMAVENBlock` now classifies collected exports into `peak_table` vs
`mid_table` using the locked header heuristic and routes them through
the concrete LCMS loaders. `AccuCorR` now resolves the bundled default
driver script, patches `script_path` / `entry_function` / `language` /
`mode` into the delegated `CodeBlock` config, materialises peak-table
and sample-metadata inputs to CSV for the R subprocess contract, and
wraps the returned MID CSV as a typed `MIDTable`. `GraphPadBlock`
remains intentionally pending for the separate Worker A follow-up chunk
(`T-LCMS-019`).

### T-LCMS-008 — `Calculate13CEnrichment`

**a. Ticket ID and name**: T-LCMS-008 — `Calculate13CEnrichment`
weighted-average enrichment per compound per sample.

**Status note (2026-04-08)**: Implemented in issue #366 / PR #371

**f. Existing tests to update**: none.

**g. Implementation details**:

This is the **flagship block** of the plugin's isotope-tracing USP.
Formula (for single tracer `C13`):

```
enrichment[compound, sample] = sum(n * M+n[compound, sample]) / n_max
```

where `n` is the 13C atom count for isotopologue M+n,
`M+n[compound, sample]` is the fractional abundance in that sample, and
`n_max` is the maximum 13C count for that compound (i.e. the compound's
maximum possible 13C labelling, which equals the maximum row value in
the `C13` column for that compound).

**Rationale for dividing by `n_max`**: the raw weighted sum
`sum(n * M+n)` gives the *mean number of labelled atoms per molecule*.
Dividing by `n_max` normalises this into a fraction between 0.0 (no
labelling) and 1.0 (full labelling of every carbon position). This
matches the metabolomics convention reported in Antoniewicz (2018)
*"A guide to 13C metabolic flux analysis"* for "average 13C enrichment"
(also called "carbon enrichment").

**Multi-tracer case**: when `len(tracer_atoms) > 1`, the formula is
applied separately to each tracer atom, producing one enrichment column
per tracer (e.g. `enrichment_C13`, `enrichment_H2`). The output schema
has one row per `(compound, sample)` with one enrichment column per
tracer.

**Output shape**: **LONG format** — one row per `(compound, sample)`
combination. Columns: `compound`, `sample`, `enrichment` (for single
tracer) or `compound`, `sample`, `enrichment_{atom}` for multi-tracer.

Why long: matches the `MIDTable` long convention (§8 Q-3) and enables
simple `groupby` patterns in downstream blocks (`CompareGroupMID`,
`FluxEstimate`).

**Worked example** (user's verbatim cytosine):

```
Compound    C13  H2  UL0  UL3    UL2    UL1    SE3
cytosine    0    0   1    1      0.9995 1      0.9542
cytosine    1    0   0    0      0      0      0.0029
```

For `compound="cytosine"`, `tracer_atoms=["C13"]`,
`sample_columns=["UL0", "UL3", "UL2", "UL1", "SE3"]`:

- `n_max = max(C13 column for cytosine) = 1`
- For sample `UL0`: `enrichment = (0*1 + 1*0) / 1 = 0.0`
- For sample `UL3`: `enrichment = (0*1 + 1*0) / 1 = 0.0`
- For sample `SE3`: `enrichment = (0*0.9542 + 1*0.0029) / 1 = 0.0029`

The fact that `n_max = 1` in this truncated example is because the
verbatim sample only shows two rows (M+0, M+1). A real cytosine MID
would have `n_max = 4` (cytosine has 4 carbons) and rows for M+0 .. M+4.
The formula generalises correctly.

**h. Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] `Calculate13CEnrichment` subclasses `ProcessBlock` and
      `_LCMSBlockMixin`.
- [ ] `category == "process"`.
- [ ] Input port `mid_table` accepts `MIDTable`.
- [ ] Output port `enrichment` produces a `DataFrame`.
- [ ] Single-tracer output has columns `compound`, `sample`,
      `enrichment`.
- [ ] Multi-tracer output has columns `compound`, `sample`,
      `enrichment_{atom}` for each tracer.
- [ ] `n_max == 0` short-circuits to `enrichment == 0.0` (avoids
      division by zero).
- [ ] Raises `ValueError` if the compound column is missing.
- [ ] Raises `ValueError` if a tracer atom column is missing.
- [ ] Output is long format (one row per `(compound, sample)`).
- [ ] `tracer_atoms` is read from `MIDTable.meta`, not from config
      (single source of truth).
- [ ] 12 tests pass, including the user's verbatim cytosine example.

**i. Out of scope**:
- Wide-format output (pivot is a generic CodeBlock one-liner).
- Error correction for skewed MID distributions.
- Confidence intervals — these need biological replicates.
- Natural abundance correction (already done upstream by AccuCor).
- Support for tracers outside `_KNOWN_ATOM_COLUMNS` (rare; users can
  add to the set via a follow-up PR if needed).

### T-LCMS-009 — `FractionalLabeling`

**a. Ticket ID and name**: T-LCMS-009 — `FractionalLabeling`
(`1 - M+0` per compound per sample).

**Status note (2026-04-08)**: Implemented in issue #366 / PR #371
(`feat/issue-366/T-LCMS-008-012-isotope-core`). The block now computes
`1 - M+0` from `MIDTable.meta.tracer_atoms` / `sample_columns` and the
spec-listed error path for missing M+0 rows is covered by real tests.

**b. Source ADR / spec sections**:
- Master plan §2.4 LC-MS isotope tracing.

**c. Files to be created**:

**f. Existing tests to update**: none.

**g. Implementation details**:

Simpler than `Calculate13CEnrichment`:

```
fractional_labeling[compound, sample] = 1 - MID[compound, m_n=0, sample]
```

where `MID[compound, m_n=0, sample]` is the `M+0` row for that compound
in the MID table — i.e. the row where every tracer-atom column is 0.

For multi-tracer, the M+0 row is the intersection (all tracer atom
columns must be 0). The computation is straightforward:

```python
def process_item(self, item, config, state=None):
    df = item.user.get("pandas_df") or pd.DataFrame(item.view().to_memory())
    tracer_atoms = item.meta.tracer_atoms
    sample_cols = item.meta.sample_columns

    # Select M+0 rows: all tracer columns are 0.
    mask = pd.Series([True] * len(df))
    for atom in tracer_atoms:
        mask &= (df[atom] == 0)
    m0_rows = df[mask]

    rows = []
    for _, r in m0_rows.iterrows():
        compound = r["Compound"]
        for sample in sample_cols:
            rows.append({
                "compound": compound,
                "sample": sample,
                "fractional_labeling": 1.0 - float(r[sample]),
            })
    out_df = pd.DataFrame(rows)
    ...
```

Raises `ValueError` if any compound lacks an M+0 row (this indicates an
upstream data problem).

**h. Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] Subclasses `ProcessBlock` and `_LCMSBlockMixin`.
- [ ] Input port `mid_table` accepts `MIDTable`.
- [ ] Output port `fractional_labeling` produces a `DataFrame` with
      columns `compound`, `sample`, `fractional_labeling`.
- [ ] `0 <= fractional_labeling <= 1` for valid MIDs.
- [ ] Raises `ValueError` if any compound lacks an M+0 row.
- [ ] Uses `MIDTable.meta.tracer_atoms` / `sample_columns` as the
      source of truth.
- [ ] 8 tests pass.

**i. Out of scope**:

### T-LCMS-010 — `CompareGroupMID`

**a. Ticket ID and name**: T-LCMS-010 — `CompareGroupMID` per-isotopologue
statistical comparison between sample groups.

**Status note (2026-04-08)**: Implemented in issue #366 / PR #371
(`feat/issue-366/T-LCMS-008-012-isotope-core`). Two-group statistical
comparison, correction modes, and the `>2 groups -> UnivariateStats`
boundary now have concrete code and synthetic test coverage.

  - `test_three_groups_not_supported_by_ttest`

**f. Existing tests to update**: none.

**g. Implementation details**:

Input: `MIDTable` + `SampleMetadata` + `group_column: str` config.
Config:
- `test: "t-test" | "wilcoxon" | "mann-whitney"` (default `"t-test"`)
- `correction: "bonferroni" | "fdr" | "none"` (default `"fdr"`)
- `per_isotopologue: bool = True`
- `alpha: float = 0.05`

Algorithm:

1. Join `MIDTable` sample columns to `SampleMetadata[group_column]` by
   sample ID.
2. For each compound × isotopologue (or compound × {summed M+n>0} if
   `per_isotopologue=False`):
   a. Split samples by group.
   b. Run the chosen test via `scipy.stats`
      (`scipy.stats.ttest_ind`, `scipy.stats.wilcoxon`,
      `scipy.stats.mannwhitneyu`).
   c. Record p-value.
3. Apply multiple-testing correction via
   `statsmodels.stats.multitest.multipletests` (import inside the
   function body so `statsmodels` is a soft dependency — declare in
   the plugin's optional extras, and the block raises a clear
   `ImportError` guiding the user).
4. Emit a long-format DataFrame.

Output columns (long format):

| Column              | Type   | Notes                                             |
|---------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `compound`          | str    | Compound name                                     |
| `isotopologue`      | str    | `"M+0"`, `"M+1"`, ... (omitted if `per_iso=False`) |
| `group1`            | str    | First group name                                  |
| `group2`            | str    | Second group name                                 |
| `group1_mean`       | float  | Mean MID in group1                                |
| `group2_mean`       | float  | Mean MID in group2                                |
| `pvalue`            | float  | Raw test p-value                                  |
| `pvalue_adj`        | float  | Corrected p-value                                 |
| `significant`       | bool   | `pvalue_adj < alpha`                              |

**Limitation**: t-test and wilcoxon assume 2 groups; if >2 groups are
present, the block raises `NotImplementedError` pointing to
`UnivariateStats` (T-LCMS-015) which supports ANOVA.

**h. Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] Subclasses `ProcessBlock` and `_LCMSBlockMixin`.
- [ ] Input ports: `mid_table` (MIDTable) and `sample_metadata`
      (SampleMetadata), both required.
- [ ] `config_schema` has `test`, `correction`, `per_isotopologue`,
      `group_column`, `alpha`.
- [ ] Two-group t-test, Wilcoxon, and Mann-Whitney all produce sane
      p-values on synthetic fixtures.
- [ ] Bonferroni correction: `pvalue_adj = min(1, pvalue * n_tests)`.
- [ ] FDR correction: BH method via `statsmodels.multipletests`.
- [ ] `none` correction: `pvalue_adj == pvalue`.
- [ ] `significant == pvalue_adj < alpha`.
- [ ] Raises `ValueError` on missing `group_column` or single group.
- [ ] Raises `NotImplementedError` if >2 groups (pointer to
      `UnivariateStats`).
- [ ] 12 tests pass.

**i. Out of scope**:
- ANOVA / Kruskal-Wallis (use `UnivariateStats` T-LCMS-015).

### T-LCMS-011 — `FluxEstimate`

**a. Ticket ID and name**: T-LCMS-011 — `FluxEstimate` simple
steady-state flux via labelling rate × pool size.

**Status note (2026-04-08)**: Implemented in issue #366 / PR #371
(`feat/issue-366/T-LCMS-008-012-isotope-core`). The block now performs
the spec's naive linear-fit flux estimate and keeps the explicit
non-13C-MFA disclaimer in code and tests.

  - `test_disclaimer_in_docstring`

**f. Existing tests to update**: none.

**g. Implementation details**:

The block's contract, loudly documented:

> This is the **simplest possible** flux estimate: `flux = labeling_rate
> × pool_size`, where `labeling_rate` is the slope of a linear fit to
> fractional labelling vs. time, and `pool_size` is the total compound
> abundance from an optional `PeakTable`. This is **not a replacement
> for INCA, OpenFLUX, or Metran** — those tools solve elementary
> metabolite unit (EMU) systems for proper 13C-MFA.

Algorithm:

1. Unpack `MIDTable` + `SampleMetadata` + optional `PeakTable`.
2. Compute fractional labelling per compound per sample via the same
   `1 - M+0` formula as `FractionalLabeling`.
3. Join fractional labelling to `SampleMetadata[time_points_column]`.
4. For each `(compound, group)` combination:
   a. If < 2 distinct timepoints, raise `ValueError`.
   b. Linear fit `fractional_labeling ~ time` via `numpy.polyfit`
      degree 1.
   c. `labeling_rate = slope` of the fit.
5. If `pool_size_table` is provided, average the pool size per compound
   per group from the PeakTable's intensity column.
6. Flux `= labeling_rate × pool_size` (or just `labeling_rate` if no
   pool size).
7. Emit a long-format DataFrame with columns `compound`, `group`,
   `labeling_rate`, `pool_size` (optional), `estimated_flux`.

Inputs / config:

```python
input_ports = [
    InputPort(name="mid_table", accepted_types=[MIDTable], required=True),
    InputPort(name="sample_metadata", accepted_types=[SampleMetadata],
              required=True),

    },
    "required": ["time_points_column"],
}
```

**h. Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] Subclasses `ProcessBlock` and `_LCMSBlockMixin`.
- [ ] Input ports: `mid_table`, `sample_metadata`, `pool_size_table`
      (optional).
- [ ] Output column `estimated_flux` matches `labeling_rate * pool_size`
      (or just `labeling_rate` when no pool size).
- [ ] Uses `numpy.polyfit` for the linear fit (degree 1).
- [ ] Raises `ValueError` on fewer than 2 timepoints per group.
- [ ] Raises `ValueError` on missing `time_points_column`.
- [ ] Block docstring explicitly disclaims it is NOT a 13C-MFA
      replacement and points at INCA / OpenFLUX / Metran.
- [ ] Output is long format.

### T-LCMS-012 — `PoolSizeNormalize`

**a. Ticket ID and name**: T-LCMS-012 — `PoolSizeNormalize` intensity
normalization for PeakTables.

**Status note (2026-04-08)**: Implemented in issue #366 / PR #371
(`feat/issue-366/T-LCMS-008-012-isotope-core`). `IS`, `TIC`, and
`median` normalization now return a preserved-type `PeakTable` with the
spec-required meta retention and error handling.

**b. Source ADR / spec sections**:

**c. Files to be created**:

  - `test_preserves_peak_table_meta`
  - `test_output_column_renamed_or_inplace`

**f. Existing tests to update**: none.

**g. Implementation details**:

Three methods:

- **`IS`** (internal standard): divide every sample's intensity by the
  intensity of a reference compound in that sample. Requires
  `reference_compound: str` config.
- **`TIC`** (total ion current): divide every sample's intensity by
  the sum of all intensities in that sample.
- **`median`**: divide every sample's intensity by the median
  intensity across all compounds in that sample.

The output preserves the input `PeakTable`'s `Meta` (source, polarity)
so downstream blocks still see a typed `PeakTable`.

Config:

```python
{
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "method": {
            "type": "string",
            "enum": ["IS", "TIC", "median"],

        },
        "intensity_column": {"type": "string", "default": "intensity"},
        "compound_column": {"type": "string", "default": "compound"},
    },
}
```

**h. Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] Three methods implemented: `IS`, `TIC`, `median`.
- [ ] `IS` raises `ValueError` if `reference_compound` is not set.
- [ ] `IS` raises `ValueError` if the reference compound is not in the
      PeakTable.
- [ ] Output is a `PeakTable` (not a plain `DataFrame`).
- [ ] `PeakTable.meta` (source, polarity) is preserved.
- [ ] 8 tests pass.

**i. Out of scope**:
- QC-based normalization (QC blocks are out of scope entirely).
- Lowess / probabilistic quotient normalization — follow-up.
- Per-batch normalization — follow-up.

**j. Dependencies on other tickets**: T-LCMS-001, T-LCMS-002, T-LCMS-004.

```python
class MetaboliteMatrix(_LCMSBlockMixin, ProcessBlock):
    """Pivot a long-format PeakTable to a wide compound × sample matrix."""

    input_ports = [
        InputPort(name="peak_table", accepted_types=[PeakTable], required=True),
        InputPort(name="sample_metadata", accepted_types=[SampleMetadata],
                  required=False),
    ]
    output_ports = [
        OutputPort(name="matrix", accepted_types=[DataFrame]),
    ]

    config_schema = {

            "sample_column": {"type": "string", "default": "sample_id"},
        },
    }
```

The block uses `pandas.pivot_table(index=compound_column,
columns=sample_column, values=value_column)` to produce the wide matrix.
If `sample_metadata` is provided, the column order is taken from the
metadata (so downstream visualisations get a consistent ordering).

Missing `(compound, sample)` combinations become `NaN`; imputation is
the caller's responsibility (use `MatrixPreprocess`).

**h. Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] Pivots long → wide correctly.
- [ ] Default column names match spec (`intensity`, `compound`,
      `sample_id`).
- [ ] Missing combinations → `NaN`.
- [ ] Output is a generic `DataFrame` (not a `PeakTable`, since the
      shape no longer matches peak-table conventions).
- [ ] Preserves sample order from metadata when provided.
- [ ] 8 tests pass.

**i. Out of scope**:
- Multi-value pivots (e.g. simultaneous intensity + area).
- Aggregation functions other than first (user should
  deduplicate upstream).

**j. Dependencies on other tickets**: T-LCMS-001, T-LCMS-002, T-LCMS-004.

```

Pipeline order (documented in the block's docstring):

1. **Impute** — fill NaNs per the chosen method.
   - `knn`: `sklearn.impute.KNNImputer(n_neighbors=5)`.
   - `mean`: column-wise mean.
   - `zero`: constant 0.
   - `none`: no imputation (NaNs propagate).
2. **Log transform** — `log2(x + pseudocount)` where
   `pseudocount = min_positive_value / 2`. Skipped if
   `log_transform=False`.
3. **Scale**:
   - `auto` → z-score (mean-centred, unit variance per compound row).
   - `pareto` → mean-centred, divided by sqrt(stddev) per compound row.
   - `none` → no scaling.

Imports: `sklearn.impute.KNNImputer` (already in dependencies),
`numpy`.

**h. Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] `log_transform` defaults to `True`.
- [ ] Log transform uses `log2(x + pseudocount)` with pseudocount =
      half the min positive value.
- [ ] All 4 impute methods work on synthetic fixtures.
- [ ] All 3 scale methods produce correct numerics.
- [ ] Pipeline order is impute → log → scale.

}
```

Input: `DataFrame` (metabolite matrix, rows=compounds, columns=samples)
+ `SampleMetadata`.

For each compound (row):

1. Split samples by `group_column` using the metadata.
2. Run the chosen test:
   - `t-test`: `scipy.stats.ttest_ind` (exactly 2 groups required).
   - `anova`: `scipy.stats.f_oneway` (≥ 2 groups; typically ≥ 3).
   - `wilcoxon`: `scipy.stats.mannwhitneyu` (2 groups).
3. Compute fold change (for 2-group cases): `log2(mean_group1 /
   mean_group2)`.
4. Apply multiple-testing correction.

Output columns (long format):

| Column        | Type  | Notes                                      |

    OutputPort(name="scores", accepted_types=[DataFrame]),
    OutputPort(name="loadings", accepted_types=[DataFrame]),
    OutputPort(name="plot", accepted_types=[Artifact]),
]
```

Implementation:

- PCA: `sklearn.decomposition.PCA(n_components=n)`. Data is mean-centred
  and optionally scaled (`sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler`).
- PLSDA: `sklearn.cross_decomposition.PLSRegression(n_components=n)`
  with a one-hot encoded group response. The name "PLSDA" is the
  chemometrics convention but the underlying implementation is just
  PLS regression against a binary response.
- OPLSDA: not natively in scikit-learn. Implement as "PLS with 1
  predictive component + (n-1) orthogonal components" per the
  Trygg & Wold (2002) algorithm. If this is non-trivial to land in
  the ticket's size budget, defer OPLSDA to a follow-up ticket and
  raise `NotImplementedError("OPLSDA: deferred to follow-up ticket")`.
  Document the deferral in the PR description.

Plot artifact: a scores scatter plot (samples coloured by group if
available), saved as PNG via `matplotlib.pyplot.savefig`, wrapped in an
`Artifact` with `mime_type="image/png"`.

**h. Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] PCA implementation correct (scores = `pca.transform(X)`).

- [ ] OPLSDA either implemented correctly OR raises
      `NotImplementedError` with a pointer to the follow-up ticket.
- [ ] `n_components` defaults to 2.

  - `test_output_columns_match_spec`
  - `test_raises_on_empty_input`
  - `test_cache_within_single_run`

**f. Existing tests to update**: none.

**g. Implementation details**:

Per §8 Q-6, the default implementation is Python-native via the KEGG
REST API. No R dependency.

KEGG REST endpoints:

- `https://rest.kegg.jp/link/pathway/cpd` — compound → pathway map
  (returns TSV).
- `https://rest.kegg.jp/list/pathway/{organism}` — pathway ID → name
  for an organism.

Algorithm:

1. Fetch the compound → pathway map (cached process-locally).
2. Fetch the organism-specific pathway list.
3. For each pathway:
   a. Count `hits` — the number of input compounds that map to this
      pathway.
   b. Count `total` — the total number of compounds in this pathway.
   c. Count `background` — the total number of compounds mapped to any
      pathway.
   d. Fisher's exact test for the 2×2 contingency table
      `[[hits, total-hits], [input-hits, background-input+hits]]` via
      `scipy.stats.fisher_exact`.
4. Compute fold enrichment: `(hits / input) / (total / background)`.
5. Apply FDR correction via `statsmodels.stats.multitest.multipletests`.
6. Filter by `pvalue_cutoff`.

Config:

```python
{
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "database": {"type": "string", "enum": ["KEGG"], "default": "KEGG"},
        "organism": {"type": "string", "default": "hsa"},
        "pvalue_cutoff": {"type": "number", "default": 0.05},
        "compound_column": {"type": "string", "default": "compound"},
    },
}
```

Note: `database` is an enum with only `"KEGG"` for 0.1.0. A
follow-up ticket may add `"HMDB"` / `"MetaboAnalystR"` options.

Output columns (long format):

| Column            | Type  | Notes                                |
|-------------------|-------|--------------------------------------|
| `pathway`         | str   | Pathway name (e.g. "Glycolysis")     |
| `pathway_id`      | str   | KEGG pathway ID (e.g. "hsa00010")    |
| `hits`            | int   | Input compounds matched to pathway   |
| `total`           | int   | Total compounds in pathway           |
| `fold_enrichment` | float | Observed / expected ratio            |
| `pvalue`          | float | Fisher's exact p-value               |
| `pvalue_adj`      | float | FDR-corrected p-value                |

**Caching**: process-local `dict` keyed by `(endpoint, organism)`. No
persistent cache for 0.1.0.

**Rate limiting**: KEGG REST allows ~10 requests/sec per user. The
block sleeps 100 ms between requests via `time.sleep(0.1)`.

**h. Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] Uses KEGG REST via `requests` (no R dependency).
- [ ] `organism` defaults to `"hsa"` (human).
- [ ] `pvalue_cutoff` defaults to `0.05`.
- [ ] Fisher's exact test via `scipy.stats.fisher_exact`.
- [ ] FDR correction via `statsmodels.multipletests`.
- [ ] Process-local cache (dict) used for KEGG responses.
- [ ] Rate-limiting sleep between requests (100 ms).
- [ ] Output columns match the spec.
- [ ] 11 tests pass (using `responses` or `requests_mock` to mock
      KEGG REST calls).

**i. Out of scope**:
- HMDB backend (follow-up).
- MetaboAnalystR backend (follow-up; pattern documented in §8 Q-6).
- Persistent disk cache for KEGG responses (follow-up).
- Non-human organisms beyond what KEGG supports out of the box.
- Compound ID mapping (HMDB → KEGG → InChI) — assumes compound names
  match KEGG's canonical names.

**j. Dependencies on other tickets**: T-LCMS-001, T-LCMS-002, T-LCMS-015
(typically fed by `UnivariateStats` significant compounds).

**f. Existing tests to update**: none.

**g. Implementation details**:

Per §8 Q-7:

Inputs:

- `spent_media: PeakTable` — intensities in spent media samples.
- `fresh_media: PeakTable` — intensities in fresh media controls.
- `cell_count_table: DataFrame | None` — optional per-sample cell
  counts.

Config:

```python
{
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "time_hours": {"type": "number"},
        "normalize_per_cell": {"type": "boolean", "default": False},
        "intensity_column": {"type": "string", "default": "intensity"},

        "sample_column": {"type": "string", "default": "sample_id"},
    },
    "required": ["time_hours"],
}
```

Algorithm:

1. Compute per-compound mean intensity in `fresh_media`
   (`fresh[c] = mean over all fresh samples`).
2. For each `(compound, spent_sample)`:
   a. `delta[c, s] = spent[c, s] - fresh[c]`.
   b. `consumed_or_secreted[c, s] = "consumed" if delta < 0 else "secreted"`.
   c. If `normalize_per_cell`:
      - Look up `cell_count[s]` from `cell_count_table`.
      - `flux[c, s] = delta[c, s] / (cell_count[s] * time_hours)`.
      else:
      - `flux[c, s] = delta[c, s] / time_hours`.
3. Emit long-format DataFrame.

Output columns:

| Column                   | Type  | Notes                                        |
|--------------------------|-------|----------------------------------------------|

| `sample`                 | str   | Spent-media sample ID                        |
| `delta_concentration`    | float | `spent - mean(fresh)`                        |
| `consumed_or_secreted`   | str   | `"consumed"` or `"secreted"`                 |
| `flux_per_cell_per_hour` | float | `delta / (cell_count * time_hours)` or `delta / time_hours` |

**h. Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] `time_hours` is required.
- [ ] Fresh media intensities are averaged across samples per compound.
- [ ] `delta_concentration = spent - mean(fresh)`.
- [ ] `consumed_or_secreted` flag set correctly (negative → consumed,
      positive → secreted).
- [ ] Without cell count, `flux_per_cell_per_hour = delta / time_hours`.
- [ ] With cell count, `flux_per_cell_per_hour = delta / (cell_count *
      time_hours)`.
- [ ] Raises `ValueError` if `spent_media` and `fresh_media` do not
      share at least one compound.
- [ ] Output is long format.
- [ ] 10 tests pass.

**i. Out of scope**:
- Absolute quantification (requires calibration curves).
- Per-compound unit enforcement (block assumes consistent units
  between spent and fresh).
- Time-course flux profiles (single timepoint only).

**g. Implementation details**:

Per §8 Q-8, `GraphPadBlock` is a thin `AppBlock` subclass with
**no default `app_command`** — the user must supply `graphpad_path`
explicitly because the install path varies (`Prism 9` vs `Prism 10`,
Windows-only).

```python
class GraphPadBlock(_LCMSBlockMixin, AppBlock):
    """AppBlock wrapping GraphPad Prism for final figure polishing.

    Per spec §8 Q-8, there is no default `app_command` because the
    GraphPad install path varies. The user must supply `graphpad_path`
    explicitly.

    Workflow: the block copies the input DataFrames to the exchange
    directory as CSV files, optionally copies a template .pzfx file,
    launches GraphPad, and waits for the user to export figures
    (PNG/PDF/SVG) to the exchange directory.

### T-LCMS-020 — Entry-point registration + plugin smoke test

**a. Ticket ID and name**: T-LCMS-020 — entry-point registration for
the `scieasy.blocks` / `scieasy.types` groups + plugin smoke test.

**b. Source ADR / spec sections**:
- ADR-026 (entry-point plugin discovery).
- ADR-028 §D2 (plugins register via `scieasy.blocks`).
- This spec §8 Q-12 (palette categories).

**c. Files to be created**: none (all registered files already exist).

**d. Files to be modified**:
- `packages/scieasy-blocks-lcms/src/scieasy_blocks_lcms/__init__.py`
  (finalise `get_blocks()` to return the full list of 20 block
  classes).
- `packages/scieasy-blocks-lcms/src/scieasy_blocks_lcms/types.py`
  (verify `get_types()` returns the 4 classes — already done in
  T-LCMS-002).
- `packages/scieasy-blocks-lcms/pyproject.toml` (double-check
  entry-point declarations match the `__init__.py` exports).

**e. New tests**:
- `packages/scieasy-blocks-lcms/tests/test_entry_points.py`:
  - `test_scieasy_blocks_entry_point_discovers_all_20`
  - `test_scieasy_types_entry_point_discovers_all_4`
  - `test_all_blocks_have_package_name_scieasy_blocks_lcms`
  - `test_all_blocks_have_category_from_controlled_set`
  - `test_all_blocks_have_unique_type_name`
  - `test_all_blocks_have_name`
  - `test_all_blocks_have_config_schema`
  - `test_all_blocks_importable_from_top_level`

**f. Existing tests to update**:
- `packages/scieasy-blocks-lcms/tests/test_package_layout.py`
  (T-LCMS-001): update `test_get_blocks_returns_list` to assert the
  length is now 20.

```

The smoke test verifies:

1. `get_blocks()` returns exactly 20 classes.
2. `get_types()` returns exactly 4 classes.
3. Every block has `package_name == "scieasy-blocks-lcms"`.
4. Every block's `category` is in
   `{"io", "app", "code", "process"}`.
5. Every block's `type_name` is unique across the plugin.
6. Every block has a non-empty `name` (palette label).
7. Every block has a `config_schema` (even if empty-ish).
8. All blocks are importable from the top-level package.

The test also validates via the real entry-point mechanism: it uses
`importlib.metadata.entry_points(group="scieasy.blocks")` to confirm
the plugin is discoverable via the `scieasy.blocks` group after `pip
install -e .`.

**h. Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] `get_blocks()` returns exactly 20 classes in the order defined
      above.
- [ ] `get_types()` returns exactly 4 classes.
- [ ] All 20 blocks have `package_name == "scieasy-blocks-lcms"`.
- [ ] All 20 blocks have a `category` in the controlled set.
- [ ] All 20 `type_name` values are unique.
- [ ] `importlib.metadata.entry_points(group="scieasy.blocks")` exposes
      the `lcms` entry point.
- [ ] All 8 entry-point smoke tests pass.

**i. Out of scope**:
- Adding new blocks (the list is locked at 20).
- Renaming blocks (would break workflow YAMLs).
- Changing category values (tied to palette rendering).

**j. Dependencies on other tickets**: all prior T-LCMS-NNN tickets.

**k. Estimated diff size**: ~80 lines source + ~150 lines test.
Total ~230 lines.

**l. Suggested workflow gate ticket title**:

### T-LCMS-021 — Isotope tracing integration test

**a. Ticket ID and name**: T-LCMS-021 — end-to-end isotope tracing
workflow integration test with a synthetic AccuCor fixture.

**b. Source ADR / spec sections**:
- Master plan §8 (synthetic fixtures for LC-MS — real data is not
  shipped; the 4 images in `Example/images/` are for imaging/SRS only).
- This spec §11 (full integration test body).

**c. Files to be created**:
- `packages/scieasy-blocks-lcms/tests/integration/__init__.py`
- `packages/scieasy-blocks-lcms/tests/integration/fixtures/synthetic_peak_table.csv`
  (the ElMAVEN-shaped fake peak table).
- `packages/scieasy-blocks-lcms/tests/integration/fixtures/synthetic_mid_table.csv`
  (the AccuCor-shaped fake MID table — long format).
- `packages/scieasy-blocks-lcms/tests/integration/fixtures/synthetic_sample_metadata.csv`
  (2 groups × 3 replicates × 1 timepoint).
- `packages/scieasy-blocks-lcms/tests/integration/test_tracing_workflow.py`
  (the pytest integration test).

**d. Files to be modified**: none.

**e. New tests**:
- `test_tracing_workflow.py`:
  - `test_full_isotope_tracing_pipeline`

**f. Existing tests to update**: none.

**g. Implementation details**: see §11 of this spec for the full
integration test body.

**h. Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] Three synthetic fixtures land under
      `tests/integration/fixtures/`.
- [ ] The fixtures are plausible (10–20 compounds, 6 samples, 2
      groups, long-format MID).
- [ ] The integration test runs end-to-end without any
      `@pytest.mark.requires_*` markers (no external tools, no
      network).
- [ ] The test chains: `LoadPeakTable` → `LoadMIDTable` →
      `LoadSampleMetadata` → `Calculate13CEnrichment` →
      `CompareGroupMID` → `MetaboliteMatrix` → `MatrixPreprocess` →
      `UnivariateStats` → `SaveTable`.
- [ ] The test asserts each block's output is the expected type.
- [ ] The test asserts the final `SaveTable` writes a file to disk.
- [ ] Test passes under `pytest packages/scieasy-blocks-lcms/tests/integration/`.

**i. Out of scope**:
- Real LC-MS data (the plugin does not ship raw files).
- Testing `ElMAVENBlock` / `AccuCorR` / `GraphPadBlock` end-to-end
  (these are marker-protected per T-LCMS-007 / T-LCMS-019).
- Real KEGG REST calls (tested with mocks in T-LCMS-017).

**j. Dependencies on other tickets**: T-LCMS-001 through T-LCMS-020.

**k. Estimated diff size**: ~200 lines of fixture + ~300 lines of test.
Total ~500 lines.

**l. Suggested workflow gate ticket title**:
`LC-MS isotope tracing integration test with synthetic fixtures (T-LCMS-021)`

Block count by category:

- **IO**: 5 (LoadMSRawFiles, LoadPeakTable, LoadMIDTable,
  LoadSampleMetadata, SaveTable).
- **External tools (app/code)**: 2 (ElMAVENBlock, AccuCorR) + 1 more
  app block (GraphPadBlock). 3 total.
- **Isotope tracing**: 5 (Calculate13CEnrichment, FractionalLabeling,
  CompareGroupMID, FluxEstimate, PoolSizeNormalize). **USP cluster.**
- **Metabolomics analysis**: 6 (MetaboliteMatrix, MatrixPreprocess,
  UnivariateStats, MultivariateAnalysis, PathwayEnrichment,
  ConsumptionSecretionAnalysis).
- **Total**: 5 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 1 (GraphPad is separate from metabolomics)
  = 20 blocks. Wait — GraphPad is already counted in "External tools".
  The actual total: 5 IO + 2 external wrappers (ElMAVEN, AccuCor) +
  5 isotope + 6 metabolomics + 1 plotting (GraphPad) = **19**. Adding
  the entry-point registration and integration test as non-block
  deliverables keeps the ticket count at 21. The block count is **19**.

(Note: the master plan §2.4 header says "~20 blocks" and the actual
count is 19. This is expected slack; the spec does not invent a 20th
block to hit a round number.)

## 11. Integration test — isotope tracing workflow

The full integration test at
`packages/scieasy-blocks-lcms/tests/integration/test_tracing_workflow.py`.

Per master plan §8, this plugin does **not** use the 4 imaging test
images at `Example/images/` — those are for imaging/SRS. LC-MS uses
**synthetic fixtures** generated inline (or from CSV files committed to
the repo).

### Synthetic peak table fixture

`synthetic_peak_table.csv` (ElMAVEN-shaped, ~20 rows):

```
compound,formula,medMz,medRt,S1_intensity,S2_intensity,S3_intensity,C1_intensity,C2_intensity,C3_intensity
glucose,C6H12O6,179.0561,5.2,1000,1100,950,800,850,820
lactate,C3H6O3,89.0244,3.1,200,210,190,500,520,510
pyruvate,C3H4O3,87.0088,2.8,300,310,290,600,620,610
...
```

Columns: compound identity (`compound`, `formula`), retention/mass
metadata (`medMz`, `medRt`), plus 6 sample columns (3 treatment `S*` +
3 control `C*`).

### Synthetic MID table fixture

`synthetic_mid_table.csv` (AccuCor long format, ~40 rows):

```
Compound,C13,H2,S1,S2,S3,C1,C2,C3
glucose,0,0,0.20,0.19,0.21,0.80,0.81,0.79

lactate,1,0,0.05,0.06,0.05,0.03,0.03,0.02
...
```

### Synthetic sample metadata fixture

`synthetic_sample_metadata.csv`:

```
sample_id,group,replicate,time_hours
S1,treatment,1,6
S2,treatment,2,6
S3,treatment,3,6
C1,control,1,6
C2,control,2,6
C3,control,3,6
```

This test deliberately keeps the pipeline simple (each block takes
simple inputs and produces simple outputs) so that debugging a
regression is easy. The test uses no external tools (ElMAVEN, R,
GraphPad are all excluded) and no network calls (PathwayEnrichment is
excluded because it hits KEGG REST).

A **separate** marker-protected integration test file
(`test_tracing_workflow_external.py`) may be added in a follow-up
ticket to chain `ElMAVENBlock` → `AccuCorR` → `Calculate13CEnrichment`
end-to-end. That test would be marked
`@pytest.mark.requires_elmaven and requires_r`.
